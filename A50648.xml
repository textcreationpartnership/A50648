            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Limits of it in times paſt, was from the <hi>Orcades,</hi> to the <hi>Pyrean</hi> Mountains.</p>
               <p>And in former times this noble Iſland of <hi>Britain</hi> ſuſtained Eleven Kings, all commanding great powers: ſeveral other Iſlands belong to it, amongſt which <hi>the Iſle of Man,</hi> is not of the leaſt account, for to it belongs a King with a <hi>Leaden Crown,</hi> whoſe King is now the Noble Earl of <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> whoſe Anceſtors have been Lords of Man about two hundred and ſeventy years.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:65606:8"/>It is verily ſuppoſed that this Iſland was Peopled before the Flood. <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> affirmeth that this Iſland was Peopled by <hi>Brute</hi> with his <hi>Trojans,</hi> in the 2887 year of the World's Creation; and after the univerſal Deluge 1231 years.

               <p>The Inhabitants were called <hi>Britains</hi> from the word <hi>Brith,</hi> which ſignifieth painting or ſtaining of the Skin, which they had formerly in uſe amongſt them.</p>

all we can gather is from forein Writers.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Druides</hi> were accounted among the firſt Inhabitants, for their only wiſe Men: in antient times the <hi>Britains</hi> uſed to die themſelves blew with <hi>Woad,</hi> to make themſelves ſeem more terrible to their Enemies; and about their Waſts and Necks they uſed to wear chains of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, ſuppoſing them a brave Ornament; on their middle Fingers they wore their Rings, and uſed no Garments that their painted Skins might be ſeen; yet ſome of them, but very few, were clad in Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pickts</hi> alſo a branch of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> race, were ſo called of the <hi>Romans,</hi> from their painted Skins.</p>
               <p>The antient <hi>Britains</hi> are reported by <hi>Plutarch</hi> to have lived long, as 120 years; and thoſe of <hi>Kent</hi> in former times were accounted for the moſt civil perſons among them, their fortified Woods they called Towns; their cuſtom was to have ten or twelve Wives apiece, which were in common amongſt Brothers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; yet the Iſſue was always reputed his, who firſt married the Mother when ſhe was a Maid: their Diet was very ſpare: They would neither eat <hi>Hen, Hare, Gooſe, Fiſh,</hi> nor <hi>milk;</hi> They
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65606:9"/>
manured their grounds with <hi>marl</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>dung,</hi> and their uſual drink was made of <hi>Barly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In their ſacrifices they uſed Man's Fleſh, and their Idols exceeded in number thoſe of <hi>Egypt:</hi> Art-Magick was had in great eſteem amongſt them: but moſt of their controverſies were determined by the <hi>Druides:</hi> Theſe had no Primate or Chief amongſt them: and <hi>Excommunication</hi> was amongſt them of great force: Their <hi>Theologie</hi> was, that the Soul dieth not, but paſſeth from one to another; And their Traffick or Merchandize was of very ſmall uſe or profit to them; For <hi>Ceſar</hi> reports that the Ribs and Keels of their Ships, were of light wood, and covered over with Leather, and they did not eat during the time they ſailed at Sea.</p>
               <p>Their Coins at firſt were either of <hi>Braſs,</hi> or <hi>Iron</hi> Rings, ſized at a certain weight, which they uſed inſtead of Money; but afterwards they ſtamped Silver and Gold, <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> was the firſt that ſtamped his own Image on the <hi>Roman Coin:</hi> but the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Coin is eaſily known from other; for they commonly imboſſed their Coin outward and Shield like, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inſcription or Face is ſeen; and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65606:10"/>
Reverſe hollow wherein the Device is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: They uſed not to fight in great Companies, for they had ever freſh Men to come in to ſupply the vacancies of thoſe that retired and were weary; and their uſual fightings was in Chariots, as the uſe was in the world's firſt Age; but their chiefeſt Strength conſiſted in Foot men, who were very ſwift, whoſe Armor was Shields and ſhort Spears; in the nether end whereof was faſtned a round Bell of <hi>Braſs,</hi> with the ſound whereof they were wont to affright their Enemies: And it was uſual with them to Fight under the conduct of their Women, who were ſecond <hi>Amazons.</hi>

                  <hi>Ceſar</hi> (the firſt <hi>Roman</hi> Diſcoverer of <hi>Britain</hi>) when he firſt made Diſcovery thereof, thought verily that he had found another World: It is called the great Iſland by ſome, it was formerly called <hi>Samothea,</hi> from <hi>Samothes,</hi> ſixth Son of <hi>Japheth,</hi> the firſt Inhabiter 252 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flood: it was alſo called <hi>Albion;</hi> ſome ſay, from <hi>Albion</hi> a Gyant the Son of <hi>Neptune,</hi> who conquered the <hi>Samothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and ſeated himſelf here about 335 years after the Flood; but others ſay it was called <hi>Albion, ab Albis Rupibus,</hi> from

the white Rocks, appearing on the South Coaſt next to <hi>France,</hi> and this is the more likely to Truth: But by the <hi>Grecians</hi> this Iſland was called <hi>Britain,</hi> but why ſo called, ſeveral Authors have given ſeveral Reaſons; ſome will have it from King <hi>Brute</hi> the Son of <hi>Silvius;</hi> others will have it derived from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>It was called <hi>England</hi> from a place in <hi>Denmark</hi> called <hi>Engloen.</hi> And this Name was not changed either by the <hi>Daniſh</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> Conquerors. It hath the fifth place in all general Counſels, and retained the name of <hi>England</hi> 873 years: But ſince King <hi>James</hi> came to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, in the year 1602: <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>England</hi> were both united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Crown; it is ſometimes called <hi>Great Britain.</hi>

                  <hi>Britain</hi> hath been taken for the fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Iſland, as is reported by ſome Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: And Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> was ſo in love with it, that he made ſuit to <hi>Henry</hi> the Third King of <hi>England,</hi> to come and ſee

it, but could not prevail. It is obſerved that the nights in the furtheſt part North of <hi>Britain</hi> are ſo ſhort in Summer, as the ſpace between the days going and coming is not deſernable. And <hi>Ceſar</hi> did obſerve that <hi>France</hi> was colder than <hi>Britain.</hi> Such plenty of all kind of Grain abounds in it, That by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, it was called the <hi>Granary</hi> or <hi>Store-houſe</hi> of the weſtern World; here the <hi>Romans</hi> uſed yearly to lade 800 Veſſels bigger than Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with Corn, for the Releif of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies elſewhere.</p>
               <p>This Iſland is thought to have received the <hi>Chriſtian Faith</hi> in or about the midſt of <hi>Nero's</hi> Reign, in the year of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Incarnation 63: and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea</hi> was one of the Diſciples ſent hither by <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle out of <hi>France,</hi> and that this <hi>Joſeph</hi> lyeth Buried at the Abby of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> if we believe <hi>Guildas</hi> and <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> who have written ſo: It is thought that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did Preach here in <hi>Brittain,</hi> and ſome affirin that <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Zelotes</hi> was here in <hi>Britain:</hi> but theſe things being but conjectural, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter, and proceed to the next.</p>

Traytors and Flatterers: for on a time he cauſed himſelf to be placed in a Chair, where the Sea ebbs and flows at <hi>Southampton,</hi> and commanded the Sea, <hi>that it ſhould not ſwell ſo as to wet his Feet;</hi> but the diſobedient Sea (the Tide then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out) preſently daſhed up to his Thighs; whereupon he ſtarted up, and ſaid to the Flatterers (who had extoll'd his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be unmatchable,) <hi>You ſee all the might and power of Kings is but vanity, for none is worthy to have the name of King, but he that hath all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THeſe <hi>Normans,</hi> who by the Sword gained the Diadem of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and were the laſt Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors thereof, in whoſe Line the Monarchy of <hi>England</hi> is ſtill continu'd, were antiently a mixt Nation with the Warlike <hi>Norwegians, Swedens,</hi> and <hi>Danes;</hi> and took their Name from that Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, antiently called <hi>Cimbrica Cherſone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and <hi>Norway:</hi> but the Country being thought to be too little for theſe People: <hi>Rollo,</hi> a Famous Noble <hi>Norman,</hi> with many others in his Company, betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Sea, to ſeek Fortunes Court: and having practiſed ſome Piracies upon the Coaſts of <hi>Belgia, Frizia, England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> at length they became ſo fearful to the <hi>French,</hi> that <hi>Charles</hi> the Simple, King of <hi>France,</hi> gave to <hi>Rollo</hi> his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Gilla</hi> in Marriage with the Dutchy of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65606:62"/>
                  <hi>Normandy:</hi> And this Duke <hi>Rollo</hi> was <hi>Proavus</hi> or Great Grandfather to <hi>Richard</hi> the Fifth Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> which <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> was Elder Brother to <hi>Robert,</hi> Father to this <hi>WILLIAM</hi> the Famous Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Famous Actions and Memorable Things we ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Treat of.</p>
               <p>After the Fight at <hi>Battle-Field,</hi> Duke <hi>William</hi> haſted towards <hi>London,</hi> waſting as he went the Counties of <hi>Kent, Suſſex, Surry, Hampſhire,</hi> and <hi>Bark-ſhire;</hi> he croſt Thames at <hi>Wallingford,</hi> and ſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thorow the Counties of <hi>Oxford, Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> and <hi>Hartford.</hi> And at <hi>Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampſtead,</hi> he made a Stop: to which place repaired <hi>Aldred</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wolſtan</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winchester, Walter</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Hereford,</hi> the Earls <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morcar,</hi> and <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> the Heir to the Crown; and here did their Allegiance to the Duke.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65606:63"/>
March towards <hi>Dover,</hi> at the Inſtigation of <hi>Stigand</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Egleſine</hi> Abbot of Saint <hi>Auſtines,</hi> he was ſurprized by the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men, who carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Boughs and Branches of Trees in their hands, they ſeemed like a Walking Wood, which ſight ſo afrighted the Conqueror, that he granted their Requeſts, <hi>to have all their Ancient Cuſtoms:</hi> whereupon they yielded up to him their Earldom of <hi>Kent,</hi> and Caſtle of <hi>Dover.</hi> The Conqueror was kind alſo to the <hi>Londoners,</hi> ſuffering them to injoy their Priviledges they had in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confeſſor's time.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this the Conqueror ſailed to <hi>Normandy</hi> to ſettle his Affairs there, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles (whoſe greatneſs he feared in his Abſence) for Pledges, and making his half Brother <hi>Otho,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayeux,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> and <hi>William Fitz-Osburne</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> to whoſe Truſt he left the Government of the Kingdom till his Return: In whoſe Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the <hi>Welſh</hi> rebelled and waſted all to the Mouth of <hi>Wye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> theſe Stirs called the Conqueror back again, who at his Return gave the Lands of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to his <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus turned out of their Eſtates, fell ſo to Rob and Pillage that the High-wayes between one Town
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65606:63"/>
and another lay unfrequented: The Earls <hi>Edwin</hi> and <hi>Morcar,</hi> and <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> with his Mother and Siſter and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles fled into <hi>Scotland</hi> to King <hi>Malcolm,</hi> to whom the Conqueror ſent, deſiring him to ſend back for <hi>England Edgar Atheling,</hi> but <hi>Malcolm</hi> having married his Siſter, denied him, and kept him notwithſtanding all King <hi>William</hi>'s Threats. And now the <hi>Conqueror</hi> ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in his Oppreſſions of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he cauſed every Houſe-houlder to put out both Fire and Candle at eight a Clock at Night, to which purpoſe there was a Bell rung in every City, Town or Village, by the French called <hi>Cover few,</hi> that is, <hi>Cover Fire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Second year of his Reign, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine</hi> and <hi>Edmund</hi> two of King <hi>Harrold</hi>'s Sons invaded the Realm out of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and took away great Bootys. And the year after, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the North ſlew 700 <hi>Normans,</hi> but ſome of the Authors of the Rebellion, being taken, had ſome of them their Heads cut off, and other their hands: And now <hi>Swain,</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> aſſiſted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with 300 Sail of Ships fraught with Soldiers, who under Command of <hi>Osburne, Swaine</hi>'s Brother, and his own two Sons <hi>Harrold</hi> and <hi>Canute,</hi> arriv'd in

                  <hi>Humber</hi> and marched for <hi>York:</hi> at whoſe Approach the <hi>Yorkists</hi> were ſo diſmay'd that they ſet their own City on fire, and the Minſter of St. <hi>Peters</hi> being then conſum'd, <hi>Aldred</hi> their Archbiſhop died with greif.</p>
               <p>At his time were 3000 <hi>Normans</hi> ſlain, but the King hearing of theſe Stirs, took his March into the <hi>North,</hi> and after he had overthrown the Enemy, he was ſo inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the Northern Diſturbers that he ſpoil'd their Country, lying all level with the ground for Threeſcore miles, between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Durham,</hi> which lying untilled for nine years ſpace, cauſed ſuch a Famine among them, That the People there eat Horſes, Dogs, Cats, yea and Man's Fleſh. Not long after this, there was a Decree made by him, That no Engliſh Scholar ſhould come to any Promotion, depriving <hi>Stigand</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury, Eglewine</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the <hi>East-angles,</hi> and ſeveral other Biſhops, for no evident Cauſe, but only to give Place to his <hi>Normans.</hi> He alſo abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, and ſet up his own in the <hi>Norman</hi> Tongue, to the great Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Hereupon the Earls <hi>Edwine</hi> and <hi>Morcar</hi> with <hi>Frederick</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> ſet up <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for their General, and rebelled againſt the Conqueror, who, ſeeing their daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:65606:64"/>
of Forces, concluded a Peace with them, and Swore <hi>To keep inviolable the Antient LAWS of the Land, and thoſe of St.</hi> Edward.</p>
               <p>But not long after he took from the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> all the Lands between <hi>Barnet</hi> and <hi>London</hi>-Stone, and bereaved all the Abbies and Monaſteries of <hi>England</hi> of all their Treaſure, ſparing neither Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices nor Shrines.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Malcolm</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> who ſided with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and King <hi>William</hi> made a League, and reared a Stone-Croſs on <hi>Stain-Moor</hi> in <hi>Weſtmerland,</hi> called the <hi>Roy-Croſs,</hi> for a Meer Mark to the Bounds of both Kingdoms. And ſhortly after this, the King took his Voyage for <hi>Normandy</hi> again, the People being there in Rebellion, but by the Proweſs of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> they were quickly brought again to their Obedience. Now, during this Stay in <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Nobles in <hi>England</hi> rebell again, but at his Return were quickly diſmaied. So he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Eyes of ſome of them to be put out, the hands of others tope cut off, and ſome were hang'd upon Gibbets, and thoſe who eſceped the beſt, were Baniſhed.</p>
               <p>No ſooner were theſe Troubles over, but <hi>Swain</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had manned 200 Sail of Ships for <hi>England</hi>'s Invaſion,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65606:65"/>
but hearing of the Nobles Overthrow, they turned Sail for <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1075. <hi>Walcher</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> purchaſed the Earldom of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> of the King, but being an uſurping cruel Fellow, the Inhabitants ſlew him: the year enſuing the Earth was hard Frozen from the midſt of <hi>November</hi> to the midſt of <hi>Aprill.</hi> And the next year after, upon <hi>Palm</hi> Sunday a blazing Star was ſeen near the Sun: and this year <hi>Robert</hi> King <hi>William</hi>'s Son, ſeized on the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy</hi> by force.

And returning for <hi>England,</hi> he built the Tower of <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1078. And this year <hi>Thur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> Abbot of <hi>Glastenbury</hi> cauſed 3 Monks to be ſlain in his Church, and 18 Men to be wounded, ſo that their Blood run down from the <hi>Altar</hi> to the Steps. And this very year alſo he cauſed a Survey to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of <hi>England,</hi> which is ſtill to be ſeen in the Book called <hi>Dooms day Book,</hi> kept in the King's Exchecquer, of every Hide of Land he exacted the ſum of ſix ſhillings,

upon this occaſion the <hi>Engliſh</hi> incited <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colm</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> King to invade <hi>England,</hi> who waſted all as far as <hi>Monk-cheſter</hi> upon <hi>Tine;</hi> The King ſent his Son <hi>Robert</hi> with an Army againſt him, who at that time laid the Foundation of a <hi>Caſtle</hi> at <hi>Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> calling it <hi>New-Castle,</hi> and from this the Town there took its Name.</p>
               <p>The King now perceiving himſelf well Seated in his Throne, began to provide for his Paſtime, and cauſed, in the South from <hi>Salisbury</hi> to the Sea, Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages and 36 Pariſh Churches to be pulled down and laid level with the Ground, and here he laied the Bounds of his <hi>New For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> for hunting in: But this Offence eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped not unpuniſhed, for in this Forreſt <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> the Kings ſecond Son, was goared by a Dear and died: and <hi>William Rufus</hi> his Third Son was ſlain by Sir <hi>Walter Tyrrel</hi> by accident, and his Grand Child <hi>Robert Curtoyſe,</hi> being in purſuit of the Game, was ſtrucken by a Bough into the Jaws, and died.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Pauls</hi> Church was ſet on Fire, and many ſtrange Judgments happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Realm; In the Twentieth year of the King's Reign, ſuch a great Flood happened, that the Hills were hereby made ſoft, and conſumed, and with their fall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65606:66"/>
overwhelmed many Villages to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement of all the people: And not long after this, ſome diſpleaſure ariſing between the King and <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> he took ſhip for <hi>Normandy;</hi> and falling ſick there, hearing of ſome ſcoffs put upon him by the <hi>French</hi> King; at his recovery he was ſo inraged, that he ſpoyled all the Weſt parts of <hi>France,</hi> and ſet the City <hi>Meux,</hi> or <hi>Nauntz</hi> on fire. By his laſt will he gave great Riches to the Church of St. <hi>Stephens</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> which was of his own Founding, and among other things, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed his Crown and Regal Ornaments to it: He put the diſtinction between the two Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York;</hi> making <hi>York</hi> Primate of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Canterbury</hi> Primate of all <hi>England;</hi> alſo he made the Churches of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to be under the Primate of <hi>York,</hi> as the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of <hi>England</hi> were under the Primate of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> At the performance of his Funeral Rights in the Church of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens,</hi> in <hi>Cane</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> being of his own Foundation; his Body was denyed Burial, by a Gentleman called <hi>Aſcelinus Fitz-Arther,</hi> who ſaid that it was the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place of his Fathers houſe Floor, which the Duke in his lifetime violently took from him, and upon his Inheritance Founded

This ſame year, <hi>viz.</hi> 1093, the King Conquered <hi>Wales,</hi> ſince which time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarchs have been accounted the chief Governours thereof. The next year the King and his Brother <hi>Robert</hi> fell at odds again, but were quickly reconciled. And <hi>Robert</hi> intending for the Holy War, did Mortgage his <hi>Dukedom</hi> to <hi>William</hi> for 6666 pound of Silver, to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with neceſſaries for the War. And now to raiſe this Sum of Money, the King laied heavy Taxes on his Subjects, and neither Churches nor Monaſteries were Priviledged from this payment. This

Voyage for the Holy War was taken in the year of our Lord 1099. And the ſame year the King built new Walls about the Tower, and likewiſe built <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall being ninety yards long, twenty four yards and two Foot broad; and yet when he firſt ſee it, he ſaid, It was too little by half, and ſo he would reſerve it for a Chamber.

               <p>He alſo ordained ſeveral good Laws, and annexed his Great Seal to them, and his Name, with the ſubſcription of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and cauſed Copies of them to be ſent into eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry County to be ſafely kept, the heads of them take as followeth in theſe Seven Branches.</p>
               <p>I. That the Church ſhould be free from Oppreſſions, and Reſervation of their Poſſeſſions upon vacancy.</p>
               <p>II. That the Heirs of the Nobilty ſhould poſſeſs the Lands of their Fathers without Redemption from the King; which Favour alſo ſhould be granted by the Nobles to their Tenants.</p>
               <p>III. That the Gentry might give in Marriage, their Daughters and Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,

without the King's Licence, ſo it were not to the King's Enemies.</p>
               <p>IV. That the Widow ſhould have her Jointure, and not be compelled to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt her own Will.</p>
               <p>V. That the Mother, or next of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhould be Guardian of the Lands of their Children.</p>
               <p>VI. That Coiners of Falſe Money ſhould be puniſhed: and a Meaſure to the length of the KING'S Arm, to be a Standard for Commerce among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And</p>
               <p>VII. That all Debts to the Crown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his own Time ſhould be forgiven, and all Murthers before the Day of his Coronation to be pardoned.</p>
               <p>With other ſuch like Indulgencies: And he alſo at this time confirmed King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Laws.</p>
               <p>And now he made Suit to <hi>Edgar</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to have <hi>Maud</hi> his Siſter to Wiſe. This Year 1100, his Brother <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> was elected King of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but he hearing of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rufus</hi>'s Death, refuſed it, in hopes of getting <hi>England</hi>'s Crown.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:65606:71"/>
him 3000 Marks yearly, and gave him royal Entertainment for ſix Moneths at Court.</p>
               <p>After this <hi>Belaſm</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and <hi>Roger Mountgomery</hi> rebelled, but they were overthrown by the King, and forced to abjure the Realm for ever. And now, the Pope's Imp, <hi>Anſelm</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> begins to ſtir, and calling a Council at <hi>London,</hi> Excommunicated all Married Prieſts, and deprived many lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Prelates, becauſe they were inveſted by the King, and not by the Pope. And now Duke <hi>Robert</hi> returned for <hi>England</hi> again, to congratulate his Brother's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and was ſo royally entertained, that at the Requeſt of his Siſter Queen <hi>Maud,</hi> he remitted the Annual payment of 3000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> marks.

And the Duke ſeeking to eſcape his Impriſonment, had both his Eyes put out by the King's Order. And now the King, begins to ſhew himſelf in his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, making no Bones of breaking his Oath made to his Peers; he baniſhed the <hi>Flemmings</hi> out of <hi>England.</hi> And about this time, to wit, <hi>Anno<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 1109. the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. took to Wife <hi>Maud</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Daughter. And, now the Affairs of <hi>Normandy</hi> being diſturbed, the King haſted thither, and after the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Rebells, he created his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son Duke thereof, by which a Cuſtom grew that thenceforth the Kings eldeſt Sons were Dukes of <hi>Normandy:</hi> after this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelm</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> died <hi>Anno Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> 1114.</p>
               <p>The High Court of Parliament, as ſome Authors affirm, was firſt ordained in this King's Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1116. in which year was exceeding great Lightning in <hi>March,</hi> and Thunder and Hail in <hi>December,</hi> and the Moon at both times ſeemed to be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into <hi>Blood.</hi> And in <hi>October</hi> the ſame year, the River of Thames was ſo dried up, that one might have gone between <hi>London</hi>-Bridge and the Tower, on foot: This year alſo King <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the Earls of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Anjou</hi> ſought

               <p>After this <hi>Anno</hi> 1119. King <hi>Lewis</hi> enters <hi>Normandy</hi> again, and between him and the King was a bloody Battel fought, and <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and many thouſands beſides were ſlain, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the day fell to King <hi>Henry,</hi> who returned Victoriouſly into <hi>Roan:</hi> And ſhortly after the Earl of <hi>Anjou,</hi> to curry the King's Favour, gave his Daughter to <hi>William,</hi> the King's eldeſt Son, in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; of which Marriage the King concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved no little Comfort, but the budding Hopes of the conceived future Happineſs were quickly cropped by the hand of Fate, for at the King's Return for <hi>England,</hi> this new marri'd couple, with <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> other two of the King's Children, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Earl of <hi>Chester,</hi> his Lady, and other Lords and Ladies were all caſt away at Sea.</p>
               <p>The King after this, <hi>Anno</hi> 1121. took to his Second Wife <hi>Adilicia,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Jeffery</hi> firſt Duke of <hi>Lovain.</hi> And now Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the II. met the King in <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> to ſee if his Threats would work the King's Submiſſion to him, that he might
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65606:73"/>
have the Packing and Dealing of the Cards for the Game of Spiritual Promotions in <hi>England:</hi> but neither Flatterings nor Threats would work upon him: At this Meeting, two Youths, Sons to the Earl of <hi>Mellent,</hi> and Servants to the King, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with two of the Popes Cardinals, with Logical Syllogiſms put the two Rabbies to the <hi>Non-plus.</hi> In this Pope's time <hi>Anno</hi> 1122. was the firſt <hi>Lateran</hi> Council held, being the ninth General Council.</p>
               <p>About 3 years after this, <hi>Anno</hi> 1125. Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſecond, ſent Cardinal <hi>Cremenſis</hi> to certifie the Abuſes of the Married Clergy; and to that purpoſe he made a Set Oration in Praiſe of <hi>CHA-STITY,</hi> and Diſpraiſe of <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1126. The King's Son in Law, the Emperor died, and his Wife return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>England,</hi> whereupon the King cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Parliament, and cauſed them to ſwear Fealty to the Empreſs his only Heir.</p>

(a Woman's Wit being beſt at a pinch) ſhe perſwaded him, That none, to her knowledge or with her conſent, were come with her, but thoſe who did and would owe him Allegiance: Hereupon he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably conveyed her to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> from which place ſhe got to <hi>Wallingford-Caſtle,</hi> and in the mean while Earl <hi>Robert,</hi> her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divulged the News of her Arrivage, whereupon he got ſuch a number of People together for her cauſe, that they were hard to be numbred.</p>
               <p>The King hereupon forthwith beſieges <hi>Wallingford-Caſtle,</hi> but not able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his deſires, he removed his Siege to <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> and in the mean time the Empreſs got to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and ſtored the City with Proviſion and other Neceſſaries: Hereupon the King withdrew to <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and ſo ſtraitly begirt the City with his Siege, that if the Empreſs had not made a ſhift to eſcape, ſhe had been here taken.</p>
               <p>The King poſſeſſing himſelf of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> Earl <hi>Robert,</hi> and <hi>Ranulph</hi> Earl of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> went againſt him with a mighty Army, and making over the River pitched their Tents in the King's ſight; the King ordering his Army, Trumpets ſounded to Battel, and the Armies joined in Fight; but the Kings party being overpowred, they began
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65606:76"/>
to faint and run away, leaving the King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt alone, who behaved himſelf ſo Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion-like, that he drove down whole Troops before him, until his Battel-Ax broke, and his Sword flew into pieces in his hand; and then being Weaponleſs he was ſtruck down with a Stone which was thrown at him, and ſo was ſeized on, but preſerved from Violence by Earl <hi>Robert's</hi> Command, and from thence he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Priſoner to the Empreſs to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> from which place he was ſent bound to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoll.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Empreſs Triumphed as ſole Sovereign of <hi>England;</hi> all the People, ſave thoſe of <hi>Kent,</hi> doing her Allegiance; to <hi>Wincheſter</hi> ſhe marched in State, and there received the Regal Crown, from thence ſhe went to <hi>London,</hi> where ſhe was received with Royal proceſſion.</p>
               <p>And now the reports of <hi>Stephen's</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment being got into <hi>Normandy,</hi> his Subjects there began to incline to <hi>Jeffery</hi> the Husband of the Empreſs: ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, Earl <hi>Robert</hi> the Empreſs Brother was taken Priſoner, by ſome of the King's party, who had eſcaped from <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who carrying him to <hi>Glouceſter</hi> there impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and growing at length weary of his Irons, and hard Lodging, he and the King
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65606:77"/>
were releaſed one in Liew of the other: The Earl after his Releaſment went for <hi>Normandy</hi> to raiſe more aid, but in the mean while King <hi>Stephen</hi> beſieged the Empreſs in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where ſhe was brought to ſuch a ſtraight, that ſhe was forced to fly by Night, with ſome of her Company, Diſguiſed, getting over the <hi>Thames</hi> on the Ice, it being then Winter, from which place they ran on Foot through Snow and Ditches to <hi>Abbington,</hi> being about five miles; and here they took Horſe, and got to <hi>Wallingford-Caſtle.</hi> And by this time Earl <hi>Robert</hi> and Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the Empreſs Son, were landed at <hi>Warran-haven</hi> from whence they got to the Empreſs; but ſhe at length being wearied with the various ſucceſs of War and never out of Troubles, left <hi>England,</hi> and returned to her Husband into <hi>Normandy,</hi> having ſent her Son <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> thither before her.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Lincoln</hi> the King (after the Empreſs Departure) cauſed all the Barrons to ſwear Allegiance to Prince <hi>Euſtace, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen</hi>'s Son; And <hi>Theobald</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> refuſing to conſecrate <hi>Euſtace</hi> King, was forced to fly into <hi>Normandy</hi> for his ſafety, and the King ſeized all his Poſſeſſions, no King before <hi>Stephen's</hi> time

               <p>After this <hi>Henry</hi> the Empreſs's Son en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>England</hi> again, and was met by the King, whoſe Armies had joined in Battel, but that the Winter Storms prevented them, and ſo a Truce was concluded, which thing was very diſpleaſing to Prince <hi>Euſtace,</hi> who not long after died of a Frenzy.</p>
               <p>After his Death, a Peace was concluded, and the King adopted Prince <hi>Henry</hi> the Empreſs's Son for his Heir and Succeſſor: In the laſt year of the King's Reign, a little before his Death, was ſeen the Sign of the Croſs in the Moon.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THis <hi>Henry</hi> was three times crowned: firſt, by <hi>Theobald</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> at <hi>Westminster:</hi> then at <hi>Lincoln:</hi> and laſtly, at <hi>Worcester.</hi> His Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil he choſe of the graveſt Peers, and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Becket</hi> his Chancellor.

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65606:78"/>
                  <hi>Scots</hi> entered Amity upon the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as were agreed upon in <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt's time. And in Token of his Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> offered his Hat and Saddle upon St. <hi>Peters</hi> Altar in <hi>York,</hi> and there left them.</p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Jews</hi> crucified a Child at <hi>Gloucester.</hi> And now <hi>Theobald</hi> dying, <hi>Becket</hi> the Chancellor was made Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and he denied to take the Oath, for obſervation of the Articles, adminiſtred to the Clergy, which the reſt of the Biſhops had taken, and were clearly againſt the Pope's Authority.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Contention between the King and <hi>Becket</hi> grew ſo hot, that the Pope ſent <hi>Philip</hi> his Almoner to perſwade the Biſhop to ſwear, who, at his Requeſt, took the Oath, <hi>Anno</hi> 1163. <hi>London</hi>-Bridge was made a new of Timber, by one <hi>Peter</hi> the Prieſt of <hi>Cole-church.</hi> And now <hi>Becket</hi> ſtanding ſeveral times in Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the King, at length was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of Perjury, and being called to hear his Sentence as a Traytor, he made ſhift to eſcape in Diſguiſe into <hi>Flanders</hi> by the Name of <hi>Deerman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the King ſends his Embaſſadors to the Pope, requeſting him to ſend two of his Cardinals to judge the Caſe, the Pope
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65606:79"/>
returned Anſwer, That he would Judg him himſelf, when he ſaw Cauſe: upon the Receit of this Anſwer, the King made an Order that all the Clergy that were with the Pope, or did Appeal to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhould have their Livings ſequeſtred; and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed all the Kinred of <hi>Becket,</hi> Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Child and Suckling.</p>
               <p>And now the King ſtoutly withſtood all the Popes Threats, Edicts and Bulls, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the payment of <hi>Peter-pence.</hi> And <hi>Roger</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> at the King's Command, in Contempt of <hi>Becket,</hi> crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Henry</hi> the King's Son. But <hi>Becket</hi> after 7 years Baniſhment, was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the King, and reſtored to his former Dignity.</p>
               <p>During theſe Stirs, there was one <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Foliott,</hi> Doctor of Divinity in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> who perſwaded the King to curb the Pride of the Clergy, and this Doctor often reprooved proud <hi>Becket</hi> to his Face, for which he was much hated and perſecuted: Now <hi>Becket,</hi> at his ſecond Entrance on his Biſhoprick, excommunicated ſeveral Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates: And King <hi>Henry,</hi> being in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi> and hearing hereof, chanced to ſpeak ſome words againſt the Biſhop; which moved four of his Courtiers to ſale for <hi>England,</hi> where in the Church of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>

they murthered Biſhop <hi>Becket, Anno</hi> 1170. He was afterwards cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized by the Pope, and is reputed amongſt thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> perſwaſion, for a great Saint<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After the King returned for <hi>England, Robert Fitz-Stephen</hi> a valliant man (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's Knowledg) ſailed for <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where he became Conqueror of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Strong-holds.

After ſome Skirmiſhes, the King conquered <hi>Ireland,</hi> and eſtabliſhed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion there; and built alſo a Magnificent Caſtle at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and ſo returned for <hi>England.</hi> About this time it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,</p>

Wife, and the third part, for his Burial, and to Pious Vſes.</p>
               <p>After this the King ſailed to <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> whither the Pope had ſent two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to take the King's Purgation for <hi>Bec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>'s Death: His Pennance was,</p>

twenty thouſand ounces of Gold for his Siſters Dowry, and twenty thouſand oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more for the Love he bore to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nation: yet, for all this ſhew of Love, he and <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> took Council a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt King <hi>Richard.

               <p>The King in his Paſſage Conquered the Iſle of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> and left in it <hi>Richard de Camvile</hi> and <hi>Robert de Tarnham</hi> Vice-Royes.

               <p>Whilſt King <hi>Richard</hi> was imployed in the Holy War, his Brother <hi>John</hi> and ſome others of the Peers deprived <hi>William Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>champ</hi> of his Command, for ſeveral Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages by him committed, eſpecially upon <hi>Jeffery</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the King's Brother. The King at his approach to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> took three thouſand Camels, and four thouſand Horſes and Mules of the <hi>Salladines</hi> coming from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and all the Carriages with their Rich Spoil.</p>
               <p>And now the Duke of <hi>Burgandy</hi> and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:65606:83"/>
his Regiment forſaking King <hi>Richard,</hi> he made a Peace with <hi>Saladine</hi> for three years, and ſo returned very Penſive that he had neither conquered <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> nor <hi>Saladine.</hi> And intending to have gone through <hi>Germany,</hi> he was taken in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe in <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the Duke ſeized him for his Priſoner: The News of the King's Impriſonment coming to <hi>England,</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other of his faſt Friends, Swore the Realm to be true to the King: and made all the Strong Holds ſure for him. But the Subjects of <hi>Normandy,</hi> in his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, were ſet upon by the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this the King regained his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, paying to the Emperor 100000 Marks ſterling, and half ſo much to the Duke for his Ranſom: the Emperor afterwards, to gratifie the King, made him King of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.

And <hi>Hubert</hi> the Arch-Biſhop, in a great Aſſembly, made an Oration, wherein he Declared that the Crown of <hi>England</hi> was meerly Arbitrary and Elective. Now the King after ſeveral Out-fals between <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> and him, at length a Peace was concluded, wherein it was agreed that <hi>Lewis,</hi> Heir of <hi>France,</hi> ſhould marry King <hi>John</hi>'s Neece.</p>
               <p>After the Peace concluded the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for <hi>England,</hi> and ordered a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection

               <p>After this, the King and <hi>William</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> meeting at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> they there ſwore Amity and Faithful Love, upon the <hi>Croſier-ſtaff</hi> of Arch-Biſhop <hi>Hubert.</hi> But now the <hi>French</hi> King breaking the Peace concluded on, ſeveral Battels were fought between him and King <hi>John,</hi> and Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> was taken Priſoner and died. The Pope ſought a Reconciliation between the two Kings, but it took no effect. After this the King returned, and called a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> at which time they granted him 33 s. 4 d. for every Knights Fee.</p>
               <p>In the year 1204, <hi>Normandy</hi> fell from <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>French,</hi> after it had been disbranched from <hi>France</hi> about 319 years, the next year after the Arch-Biſhop died, whoſe Wealth and Poſſeſſions were Seized on by the King, in Regard of his haughty

               </p>
               <p>And now the King bethinks himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on Revenge upon the <hi>French;</hi> and with a great Army landed at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and preſently won the Caſtle <hi>Mount Auban,</hi> which was reputed <hi>invincible,</hi> after this the City <hi>Angiers</hi> was alſo ſubjected by him. And at length the two Kings met, but, by the interceeding of Forein Prelates, a two years Peace was concluded.</p>
               <p>About this time the King ſent one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> a Divine of <hi>Oxford,</hi> to the Pope to defend his Authority againſt that of <hi>Rome,</hi> which he very well performed and made out both by Scripture and Reaſon: and writing againſt the Pope's Authority, he was afterwards perſecuted and baniſhed by <hi>Langton</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and died in Exile: ſhortly after this the Emperour <hi>Otho</hi> arived in <hi>England,</hi> and was Royally received by the King, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome days of Banquetting returned again. And now the Pope begins to play his Prancks, depriving Arch-Biſhop <hi>Gray,</hi> and ſetting up <hi>Stephen Langton</hi> in his place, writing to the King in his behalf: and now began the King's miſeries to approach, for upon this Account the King wrote to <hi>Pope
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:65606:86"/>
Innocentius</hi> the Third, threatning him for intruding upon his Prerogative: the Pope returned him a thundring Anſwer, and preſently after ſent his Apoſtolical command to the <hi>Prelates, London, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter</hi> to interdict the Kingdom, if the King continued in his Obſtinacy. This Commiſſion was put in Execution, and the Church Doors ſhut up for ſeveral years: ſome Authors ſay 6 years, ſo that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple lived more like <hi>Infidels</hi> than <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> for which affront ſeveral of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were baniſhed by the King, and ſent to the Pope their Maſter.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> being in Rebellion, the King haſted thither, at whoſe arrival more then twenty petty Kings came to him to <hi>Dublin,</hi> doing their Allegiance. About this time <hi>Gualter Maxes,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Oxford,</hi> preached vehemently againſt the Pride of the Pope, and wrote a Book cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Goliah,</hi> for which he was much perſecuted and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Shortly after this <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> by commiſſion from the Pope, took Ship for <hi>England,</hi> to depoſe King <hi>John,</hi> the Pope promiſing him the Crown of <hi>England:</hi> but the King prepared againſt his coming, yet fearing the <hi>French</hi> Power, he, unwillingly, ſwore to <hi>Pandulphus,</hi> the Pope's <hi>Nuncio,</hi> to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:65606:86"/>
ſubmit, in all things, to the judgment of the Church: hereupon <hi>Pandulphus</hi> ſwore him, touching all things in his Excommunication, that he ſhould ſtand to the Popes Judgment, and that he ſhould reſtore to their former Dignities the Arch-Biſhop, Biſhops and Monks: he was alſo forced to ſurrender his <hi>Crown, Scepter, Sword, Robes</hi> and <hi>King</hi> into <hi>Pandulphus</hi>'s, the Popes Attorneys, hands; laying them at his feet: And laſtly, to hold his Crown in Fee-Farm of the Pope, at the yearly Rent of 1000 Marks. And now the Pope got the Prey which he ſo long hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after: But the King was continually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peſtered with the Pope, between whom and the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> he was <hi>banded</hi> like a <hi>Tennice-Ball.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Barrons alſo proved ſeveral times diſloyal to him, and at laſt betrayed the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> ſending him their Letter of Allegiance, hereupon <hi>Lewis</hi> (againſt the Popes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand) ſet forwards for <hi>England,</hi> with 600 Ships, and 80 Boats, and landed in the Iſland of <hi>Tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:65606:87"/>
ſpoiled the Caſtles of the Barrons, which cauſed them to Repent of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyalty, forthwith returning to the King again who then lay ſick at <hi>Newark</hi> and ſhortly after died.</p>
               <p>In this King's Reign <hi>London</hi>-Bridge was built of Stone, being but of Wood at firſt, and ſeveral Prodigies were ſeen in his Reign, and alſo terrible Storms of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning with Hail Stones as big as <hi>Gooſe-Egs,</hi> which deſtroyed Men and Women, beſides Cattel and Corn Fields.</p>
               <p>In the 15 of the King, a Fire hapning in <hi>London,</hi> near the Bridge, People thronging to make ſome help, the Fire by the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Wind took hold on both ends of the Bridge, ſo that the People could not paſs either backwards or forwards, and and ſo Barges, Boats, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> coming to their Aſſiſtance, the People thronged ſo indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly into them, that the Boats ſunk, and above three thouſand Perſons were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Thames.</hi>

               <p>It is ſaid that this King <hi>John</hi> was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate in blaſphemies and execrations, and that he was ſo Luxurious that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed <hi>Matilda</hi> a Beautiful Maid, cauſing her to drink Poyſon, becauſe ſhe would not yield to his intreaty to be corrupted by him: he is alſo thought to have ſought

After this Ambaſſadors came from <hi>Gaſcoign, Poictu</hi> and <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> promiſing their aſſiſtance, if the King would go in Perſon with an Army thither: whereupon he prepared, and the concourſe of Nobles and others for the Voyage was ſo numerous, that there was not Shipping for half the Company: whereat the King was ſo inraged, that he called <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> Rank old Traytor, becauſe no more Ships were prepared, and ran at him with his Sword, and being that time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented of his Voyage, he took Shipping the next year, but returned without his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, after he had ſpent all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

               <p>Shortly after this, <hi>Iſabel</hi> the King's Siſter was married to the Emperor, there being at the Marriage 3 Kings, 11 Dukes, and 30 Marqueſſes and Earls. <hi>Anno</hi> 1235, the Jews of <hi>Norwich</hi> ſtole a Boy and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed him and had an Intention to have crucified him at <hi>Eaſter;</hi> for which Fact they were Convicted.

               <p>Now the King's Treaſures being exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with the payment of his Siſter's Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he calls a Parliament at <hi>London,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a new ſupply of Money, but was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, unleſs he would confirm <hi>MAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NA CHARTA</hi> again, and Rely wholly upon his natural Subjects for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Council: all which he granted unto. After this, the Popes Legate called a National Council, but was commanded
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:65606:91"/>
by the King to act nothing againſt his Crown or Dignity.</p>
               <p>Shortly after, the King and Queen being gone to <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> a Traytor was ſent thither by <hi>William,</hi> Son to <hi>Jeffery de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſco,</hi> out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to murther the King in his Bed, but being taken and prevented of his purpoſe, he was pulled in pieces with Wild-Horſes.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, <hi>Anno</hi> 1238, the Pope's Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate going to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he was encountred by the Students, and his Brother ſlain, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hardly eſcaping, whereupon he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the Univerſity, and made all the Biſhops (who interceeded in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities behalf) and the Students go un-gow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and bare-footed, from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church to his Houſe, being about a Mile, before he would revoke the Sentence again.</p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1245, was the firſt Council held at <hi>Lovain,</hi> being the 13 general Council, <hi>Innocent</hi> the 4 being Pope, who was the only Patron of the 3 Orders of <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Anno</hi> the 32 of the King was a great Plague in <hi>England,</hi> and the Town of <hi>New-Castle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne</hi> was burnt, Bridge and all: and about two years after in <hi>October</hi> the Sea flowed twice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ebb, which made ſuch an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

noiſe, that it was heard into <hi>England</hi> a great way; and in a dark night the Sea ſeemed to be on a Fire, and the Waves to fight one againſt another, which put the Marriners in great Fear, and overthrew a great number of Houſes at <hi>Winchelſey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King wanting more Money, called a Parliament to ſupply him, but was denied, whereupon he ſold his Jewels, Plate, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precious Stuff, ſhortning the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance alſo of his Houſe, and inviting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſometimes to one Nobleman's Table, and ſometimes to another.

               <p>Not long after this Prince, <hi>Edward</hi> the Kings eldeſt Son went into <hi>Spain,</hi> and married the Kings Siſter, whereupon the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> King quitted all his claim to <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coign</hi> to King <hi>Henry,</hi> who gave his Son <hi>Edward</hi> upon his Marriage <hi>Gaſcoin, Wales, Briſtow, Stanford</hi> and <hi>Grantham;</hi> the year after the Prince with his Wife and Royal Retinue landed at <hi>Dover:</hi> And now alſo <hi>Edmund</hi> the King's Son was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the Pope with the empty Title of King of <hi>Sicily.</hi>

                  <hi>Anno 1225, Seabald</hi> Arch Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> was proſecuted by the Pope, for Preaching and writing againſt his Holineſs's Pride. And this year, 142 <hi>Jews</hi> were brought to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> who were accuſed, and 18 of them hanged, for Crucifying a Child at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and the reſt kept Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
               <p>And now the King again, (perceiving his Coffers to be empty) cauſed ſharp Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to be made againſt Sheriffs, for the paſſing their Accompts in the Exchequer. And about this time came the <hi>Germain</hi> Ambaſſadors, with an Embaſſy to <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwall</hi> the King's Brother; wherein they declared, That their Maſters, the Princes Electors of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, had made choice of him for King; which he, after much Conſultation, accepted on.</p>
               <p>And now the Barrons fall into Rebellion again, and a Parliament being called at <hi>Oxford,</hi> thither they repaired and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves very Inſolently towards their Sovereign: hereupon the King ſailed into <hi>France,</hi> and there compounded with the <hi>French</hi> King, that he ſhould hold the Dukedom of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and Earldom of <hi>Anjou, Mayne, Touraign,</hi> and <hi>Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctue,</hi> for 300000 pounds of <hi>Touraigne;</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:65606:93"/>
and on promiſe to receive other Lands of the value of 20000 <hi>l. per annum. Anno</hi> 43, of the King, a <hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Teukesbury</hi> fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Privy upon <hi>Saturday,</hi> and refuſed to be helped out, becauſe it was their Sabboth, whereupon the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> kept him in all <hi>Sunday</hi> too, and on <hi>Monday</hi> he was dead. About this time Dr. <hi>Strenham</hi> wrote that Sufficiency of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were only neceſſary to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now the King of <hi>France</hi> being Umpire between <hi>Henry</hi> and his Barrons, he gave Judgment for the King, and the Barrons denying to ſtand to his Sentence, the King gave them Battel near <hi>Nottingham;</hi> where they received a great Overthrow, and <hi>Simon Mountforth</hi> Son to the Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> (the chief Rebell) and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Barrons, Knights and Eſquires were taken. After this Overthrow the Barrons ſent Letters twice to the King, deſiring to be reconciled, but could not be heard, which provoked them to fight the King's Army again; at which time the Fortune of the day fell to the Barrons, for they took the King and his Brother <hi>Richard</hi> King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſome other great Peers, and the next day their two eldeſt Sons yielded themſelves Priſoners.</p>
               <p>And now Earl <hi>Mountforth</hi> Joyful of

the Victory, proceeded to the Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> his Son and the Prince, in <hi>Dover:</hi> but this bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding happineſs of the Earl's was quickly cropped, for the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and he differing about parting of the Prey, the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> thereupon oppoſed the current of <hi>Leiceſter's</hi> Fortune, with whom joined the Prince (eſcaped out of Priſon) and ſeveral other Nobles, and at <hi>Everſsham</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw <hi>Leiceſters</hi> Army, and he being there ſlain, had his Head cut off, and ſent to <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> and his Hands and Feet were chopt off, and all thoſe on his party diſinheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and <hi>London</hi> is threatned to be burnt by the King for taking the Barrons part.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this, <hi>John de Warren</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey</hi> killed <hi>Allan de Zouch,</hi> in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>-Hall, upon ſome diſtaſte taken.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1264, there were 700 <hi>Jews</hi> ſlain in <hi>London,</hi> becauſe one of them would have forced a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Man to have paied more than two pence for the Uſury of 20 ſhillings the week: and the year 1269, the <hi>Thames</hi> was ſo hard frozen, that Men and Cattel paſſed over from <hi>Lambeth</hi> to <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> upon the Ice.</p>
               <p>About this time it was that Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1271, the Steeple of <hi>Bow</hi>-Church in <hi>Cheap-ſide</hi> fell down and flew many People Men and Women, and the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was a great Riot in <hi>Norwich,</hi> through which the <hi>Monaſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity</hi> was burned, whereupon the King rode down thither, and after enquiry made of the chief Actors, cauſed 50 of them to be Hanged, Drawn and Quartered, and their Quarters to be burnt.</p>
               <p>And now the King, perceiving his Death to approach, ſwore the Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> to keep the Realm for Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son.</p>

               <p>KING <hi>Edward</hi> was gone for the <hi>Holy-Land</hi> when the Crown fell to him, <hi>Elianor</hi> his Queen being with him, who, at <hi>Acon</hi> in their Voyage, was delivered of a Daughter: and at that place her Husband was Wounded by a Trayterous Villain, in three places of his Arm with a Poyſoned knife; all which Wounds (after the Chyrurgions were wearied) the Queen cured by licking out the Venom with her Tongue, yet ſhe thereby receiving no prejudice. The news of his Father's Death coming to his Ear, he forthwith returned, and after his Arrival, himſelf and Queen were Crowned by <hi>Robert Kilwarby</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury:</hi> and after this, the King called a Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which as ſome

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:65606:96"/>
the year following, <hi>Wheat</hi> was raiſed to Twenty ſhillings the quarter, by reaſon of the great Rains that fell that year; which dearth of Corn continued about 40 years, to the end of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's Reign, ſaith my Author; ſo that in proceſs of time a Buſhell of Wheat was at Ten ſhillings.</p>

               <p>Not long after this, <hi>Alexander</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> dying without Iſſue, great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions aroſe between the Lords <hi>Bruſe</hi> and <hi>Baliol</hi> about the Crown, but King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> being Umpire between them, gave Judgment for Lord <hi>Balioll,</hi> who was Crowned King, and did Homage to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> for his whole Kingdom.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, commonly called <hi>Edward of Carnarvan.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AT his firſt entrance he recalled <hi>Pearce</hi> of <hi>Gaveſton</hi> Earl of <hi>Cornwal</hi> out of Baniſhment, although he were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it by his Father's laſt Will. Shortly after, he married <hi>Iſabel</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>France;</hi> after this, calling a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they ſadly complayned of <hi>Gaveſtons</hi> Inſolence; and ſo far prevailed with the King, that he yielded to his Baniſhment, whereupon they granted to the King a Subſidy of the 20 part of their goods: but <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> not long after, was recalled again by the King, and was married to the Earl of <hi>Glouceſters</hi> Siſter, and received into greater favour than ever: the King not at all regarding his Father's Command, nor his own Oath to his Nobles. This <hi>Gave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> now grew ſo high and was ſo laviſhing of the Kings Treaſure, alienating him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from the Queens Bed, that ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained hereof to her Father the King of <hi>France.</hi> Hereupon the Nobles again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:65606:98"/>
of <hi>Gaveſton</hi> to the King, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for his Baniſhment, with a Proviſo, that if he returned again to ſuffer Death.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Anno</hi> 1311. the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Templers was expelled Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and this year, <hi>Clement</hi> the V. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope, was the Council at <hi>Vienna,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 15 general Council. The next year after, <hi>Gaveſton</hi> being returned for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he was taken by the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> at the Caſtle of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> and, with the conſent of the Earls of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi> was carried to <hi>Warwick</hi> Caſtle, and there Beheaded: hereupon the King was greatly inraged, but upon Condition that all things belonging to <hi>Gaveſton</hi> ſhould be rendred to him, He Pardoned the Lords.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1314, the King cauſed his Writs to be publiſhed for Victualls, That no Ox ſtalled or corn-fed ſhould be ſold for more than 24 ſhillings, no Graſs-fed Ox for more than 16 ſhillings, a fat ſtalled Cow at 12 ſhillings, another Cow at ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, a fat Mutton, Corn-fed, at 20 pence, another fat Mutton at 14 pence, a Fat Hog of two years old at ten groats, a Fat Gooſe at two pence half-penny, and in the City three pence, a Fat Capon at two pence, in the City two pence half-pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:65606:98"/>
a Fat Hen a penny, in the City three half-pence, 4 Pigeons for a Penny, 24 Eggs a penny, in the City twenty Eggs a penny.</p>
               <p>After this a Tanners Son of <hi>Exceter</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himſelf the Son of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and would needs prove the King a Changling, but his claim was quickly ſtrangled with a halter at <hi>Northampton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Queen was delivered of Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> and the Parliament ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after granted the King a Fifteenth: and the King going againſt <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Earls <hi>Lancaſter, Surry, Warwick,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rundel,</hi> refuſed to attend him: at this time he received a great overthrow from the <hi>Scots,</hi> he and Lord <hi>Spencer</hi> being both forced to fly, and ſeveral Lords with ſeven hundred Knights and Eſquires were ſlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1318, The Famine in <hi>England</hi> was ſo Raging, that <hi>Horſes, Dogs</hi> and <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> were ſtoln for Food: and the Thieves that were in Priſon, did pluck in pieces thoſe that were newly brought in amongſt them, and greedily devoured them half alive: by reaſon of this Famine the Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was ſo great amongſt the People, that the quick could hardly bury the dead. And not long after a great Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65606:99"/>
of kine happened, ſo that the Dogs and Ravens eating thereof were Poyſoned, and did ſwell to Death, ſo that no man durſt eat any Beef.</p>
               <p>And the next year after this the King calling a Council at <hi>Clarendon,</hi> the Lords refuſed to appear, but they were made Friends again by the Mediation of certain Cardinalls: and now the <hi>Scots,</hi> not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Honour of their laſt Victory, their King ſaled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and there cauſed himſelf to be Crowned King: but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there, under the Conduct of the Arh-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh</hi> and the Lord <hi>Binningham,</hi> encountr'd the new King who there loſt his new Honour with his life to boot: and, not long after, a Truce for two years was concluded between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Hugh Spencer,</hi> upon the Commendation of the Lords, was made Lord-Chamberlain, and his Father Earl of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and now Dr. <hi>Barrenthorp</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> taught againſt the <hi>Pope,</hi> and inveighed againſt the Deceits and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of Anti-Chriſt; after a while the two new Lords <hi>Spencers,</hi> Father and Son, grew ſo inſolent, that they far exceeded <hi>Gaveſton,</hi> alienating the Hearts of the Barrons from the King, which cauſed them
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:65606:99"/>
to take up Arms againſt him: but not long after the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and other 90 Nobles at <hi>Borrowbrigs</hi> were taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and at <hi>Pontefract</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was Beheaded, and other five Barrons hanged, and the next day at <hi>York,</hi> the Lords <hi>Clifford, Mowbray,</hi> and <hi>Dey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> were hanged in iron Chains: and now the King went againſt <hi>Scotland</hi> with an Army, but was forced there to eſcape by night, leaving his Treaſure and rich Furniture for Pillage: and the young Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> eſcaping out of the Tower, fled into <hi>France:</hi> and not long after, the Queen again ſent her complaint to her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of her ill uſage.</p>
               <p>There being now ſome Troubles in <hi>Gaſcoin,</hi> the King not going himſelf, ſent his Queen into <hi>France</hi> to Negotiate his Affairs, who drew all to agreement upon Condition that her Husband ſhould give Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> his and her Son, the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> and Earldom of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> for which places the young Prince did Homage to his Uncle the King of <hi>France:</hi> after this, the King ſending for his Son and Queen home, and they refuſing to come, they were thereupon proclaimed Enemies to the Crown: the Queen hereupon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſent either of King or Peers, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:65606:100"/>
the Prince to <hi>Philippa</hi> the Earl of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalt</hi>'s Daughter; and being now fitted for her purpoſe, ſhe raiſed an Army in <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalt</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> conſiſting of 2700 Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and many Forein and <hi>Engliſh</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and ſailing for <hi>England,</hi> landed at <hi>Orwel</hi> in <hi>Suffolk:</hi> the King having notice hereof, fled into the Weſt to raiſe Forces; promiſing a thouſand pounds to thoſe who would bring him Lord <hi>Mortimers</hi> head: but the Queen, not ſleeping in her deſign, purſued her Husband from place to place, and at length ſhe got <hi>Hugh Spencer</hi> the Father, whom ſhe cauſed to be cut-up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live and quartered; and the King lying now hid in the Abby of <hi>Neath</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> was there ſurprized by his Coſen, the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and Impriſoned in the Caſtle of <hi>Kenelworth;</hi> young Lord <hi>Spencer,</hi> and the Lords <hi>Baldock</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> being alſo taken at that time, and carried to <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> where <hi>Spencer</hi> was hanged 50 foot high, and then beheaded and quartered, and the Queen gave the bringer of his head to her 1000 pound.</p>
               <p>And now, a Parliament being called, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Peers, to wit, 3 Biſhops, three Earls, 2 Barrons, 2 Abbots, and 2 Juſtices, were ſent in the name of the Parliament, to the King at <hi>Kenelworth</hi> to Command his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:65606:100"/>
reſignation of the Crown to his Son Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> at which meſſage, the King fell into a ſwown amongſt the Peers at <hi>Kenel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> and afterwards (coming to himſelf, ſeeing no other way) reſign'd his <hi>Diadem:</hi> Whereupon Sir <hi>William Truſſel</hi> one of the meſſengers, in the name of the whole Realm, renounced Homage to the King, in theſe words,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> William Truſſel, <hi>in the name of all men of the Land of</hi> England, <hi>and of all the Parliament Procurator, do Reſſign to Thee Edward the Homage that was made to Thee ſometimes, and from this time forward now following, I defie Thee, and deprive Thee of all Royal Power, and I ſhall never be tendant to Thee, as for King, after this time.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Not long after this the King was taken from <hi>Kenelworth,</hi> and delivered by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, to the cuſtody of <hi>Thomas Gour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and Sir <hi>John Mattravers,</hi> who ſhortly after Murthered him, by thruſting an hot ſpit up his Fundament, into his Bowels, at <hi>Barclay</hi> Caſtle, for which fact they were forced to fly the Country.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, was King of <hi>England,</hi> Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1339. a Sudden Inundation of Water at <hi>New-caſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine</hi> did bear down part of the Town-Wall, where 120 Men and Women were drowned.</p>

               <p>About this time Dr. <hi>Ockham</hi> of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> wrote againſt the Popes, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Clement,</hi> affirming them to have no Power over Civil Magiſtrates.</p>

                  <hi>David Bruſe</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was forced to fly into <hi>France;</hi> and <hi>Baliol</hi> procured the Crown, and was made King, and did Homage to King <hi>Edward,</hi> as his Father had done to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt.

               <p>About the year 1340. the <hi>Iſle of Man</hi> was conquered by <hi>William Montacute</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who thereupon was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Title of <hi>King of Man.</hi> Not long after this the King created his eldeſt Son <hi>Edward</hi> (ſurnamed the <hi>Black Prince</hi>) Earl of <hi>Chester</hi> and Duke of <hi>Cornwall:</hi> and being now wholly intent upon his <hi>French War,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from King <hi>Baliol,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> the baniſhed King and his Queen returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the King, having taken his Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age for <hi>France,</hi> took upon him the Title of King of <hi>France,</hi> cauſing the <hi>Flower de Luces</hi> of <hi>France</hi> to be quartered with the <hi>Lions</hi> of <hi>England:</hi> and at this time burnt and ſpoiled the North parts of

And after this good Fortune at Sea, the King entred <hi>France,</hi> and, at the Siege of <hi>Turney,</hi> ſent to the <hi>French</hi> King a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, who refuſed to fight. About this time Dr. <hi>Bradwardine</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> wrote 3 Books in Defence of God's Grace againſt Free-Will.

to enter upon any place ſpiritual in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by the Pope's Authority.</p>
               <p>This King it was that ordained the moſt Noble Order of the Knights of the GAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TER, upon the occaſion of the Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury</hi> looſing her Garter before the King, as ſhe was Dancing, ſaith Mr. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> which the King taking up, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome of the Nobles ſmile, he looked on them, and ſaid, HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE: The number of this Order is to be XXVI. whereof the King is to be one.</p>
               <p>After this, the King, returning again for <hi>France,</hi> he muſtered there twenty five hundred Horſe, and thirty thouſand Foot, his Son <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Black-Prince</hi> being with him, who in the <hi>French</hi> Wars mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited <hi>Immortal Glory:</hi> near <hi>Creſſy</hi> the King pitched for Battel, marſhalling his Army into 3 Battalions, and barracading them up behind to prevent their flying, cauſing them all to put away their Horſes, ſo that they thereby all became Foot Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King came to the Field, bravely appointed with a gallant Army, and joining Battel, after a ſore Fight, the <hi>French</hi> were Vanquiſhed, and the Honour of the day fell to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King and his Soldiers flying

                  <p>Of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, commonly called <hi>Richard of Bourdeaux.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN the beginning of this King's Reign the <hi>French</hi> invaded <hi>England,</hi> and burnt the Town of <hi>Rye,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> the Town of <hi>Rocksbrough.</hi> And after this the <hi>French</hi> took the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> and forced the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to pay them a hundred marks: not long after they burnt the Town of <hi>Haſtings.</hi> All theſe Advantages being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by reaſon of the King's tender years; upon the Occaſion of theſe daily Rapines one Sir <hi>John Philpot</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> (ſeeing the remiſsneſs of the Lords) at his own proper coſts and charges manned out a Fleet to ſcour the Seas, which Fleet ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after took 15 Rich <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, which well recompenced Sir <hi>John</hi> for his charges. About this time <hi>Barwick</hi> was ſurprized by the <hi>Scots,</hi> who killed Sir <hi>Robert Boynton</hi> the Governour; and about nine days after it was regained by the Earl of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:65606:106"/>
the <hi>Scots</hi> being all put to the <hi>Sword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now a Parliament being called at <hi>London</hi> for Manning of thoſe Services, a Subſidy was granted to the King by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal: the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, at that time, being exempted from it.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this Sir <hi>John Arundel,</hi> and ſeveral other valiant Knights and Eſquires (being ſent to the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> for his aid againſt the <hi>French</hi>) were all drowned, But the King ſending more Forces after theſe, as the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter, Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Stafford,</hi> with others of the cheif of the Nobility; they landed ſafely at <hi>Callis,</hi> and went through <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Britain,</hi> ſpoiling Countries, burning Towns, and killing People; the <hi>French</hi> not daring to oppoſe them.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tred Bolton, John Aſhwerby, Walter Brute, John Aſhton</hi> and <hi>Peter Pateſhall</hi> were perſecuted, ſome by perpetual Impriſonment, and ſome by Baniſhment, for Preaching and maintaining Dr. <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Doctrine.</p>
               <p>After this the King calling another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Northampton,</hi> they granted him Poll-money, of Twelve pence <hi>per</hi> head, of every one above ſuch an Age.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:65606:106"/>The next year after this, the Commons of <hi>Kent, Eſſex, Surry, Suffolk, Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> rebelled, and under the Conduct of <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> and <hi>Jack Straw</hi> marched ſuriouſly to <hi>London,</hi> burning the Priory of St. <hi>John</hi>'s without Eaſt <hi>Smithfield,</hi> and turning alſo the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> into Aſhes; Beheading <hi>Simon Tybald</hi> the Archbiſhop, Sir <hi>John Hales</hi> Lord Prior, with others. And now they ſent a malicious arrogant Petition to the King, whoſe Tenor the King durſt not deny, his Perſon being then in manifeſt Danger of them. But <hi>Wat Tyler</hi> cavelled at the conditions of Peace (Suggeſting ſtrange Hopes of high mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to himſelf) hereupon he was deſired to ride to the King, which accordingly he did, and there behaved himſelf ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently that he offered to kill Sir <hi>John New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> one of the King's Attendants, for the omiſſion of ſome <hi>Punctilio</hi> of reſpect to him. But the inſolent Traytor for this affront received his Death's Wound from the hand of Sir <hi>William Walworth</hi> Lord Mayor of <hi>London.</hi> And the Lord Mayor preſently raiſing a thouſand Citizens, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed the headleſs Monſter, and cauſed them to beg their Lives of the King. <hi>John Liſter</hi> the <hi>Dyar,</hi> who headed the Rabble
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65606:107"/>
in <hi>Suffolk</hi> was alſo taken by <hi>Henry Spencer</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and there was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, of this rebellious Rabble, in <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, about 1500.</p>
               <p>Now theſe <hi>Plebean</hi> Furies being over, the King took to Wife <hi>Anne</hi> Daughter to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the IV; and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of Treaſon, touching the King's Perſon, but the Accuſers Reward was Death, which he hoped and intended for the Duke's Lot.</p>
               <p>After this, the Duke ſailing into <hi>France,</hi> concluded a Truce for about two years ſpace; and then a Parliament being called at <hi>London,</hi> the Laity ſought to depoſe the Clergy of their Eſtates, but the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their Requeſt in theſe words,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will (ſaith he) maintain the</hi> Engliſh Church <hi>in the quality of the ſame Eſtate, or better, than I found it when I came to the Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>At this Parliament was <hi>Robert de Vere</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> Created the firſt Marqueſs of <hi>Dublin.</hi> This year alſo the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> ſet Sail for <hi>Spain,</hi> to regain
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65606:107"/>
the Kingdom of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to which by Right of his Wife he laid claim to.</p>
               <p>Within a while after ſeveral Lords rebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt the King, and were all pardon'd before they came to their Tryals, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the King's Clemency, they ſtill kept together, and raiſing great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they did not ſtick to charge the King with ſeveral miſdemeanours: and now the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> returning for <hi>England</hi> again, Peace was concluded between him and <hi>Spain,</hi> and the King thereof gave him 200000 Nobles, towards the defraying of this charges he had been at; at whoſe return the King made him Duke of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, the King deſiring of the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi> the Loan of a thouſand pounds, it was denied him; whereupon he ſeized on their Liberties, and diſſolved their proper Magiſtracy, turning out their Mayor <hi>John Hind,</hi> and <hi>John Shadworth</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Wanner</hi> their Sheriffs, and appointed Sir <hi>Edward Dallingredge</hi> Warden of the City.</p>
               <p>And about two years after the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a deſire to go for <hi>Ireland</hi> had a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy granted him: four years Truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then concluded with <hi>France;</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this he with the Company of the Duke
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:65606:108"/>
of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and Earl of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> ſailed into <hi>France,</hi> where he eſpous'd the Lady <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabel</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>France:</hi> this Journey beſides Loſſes at Sea coſt him 4000 marks. At his return from <hi>France</hi> certain Peers revolted from him, making Forces, removing ſuch Officers from the King as they thought fit: whereupon the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> one of the Rebells had his Head lopt off, and the Earl of <hi>Glouce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> was ſmothered with Pillows and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beds at <hi>Callis:</hi> and ſhortly after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King made himſelf Earl of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and created ſeveral Dukes and Earls at that time.</p>
               <p>And not long after this, the River be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Swelſton</hi> and <hi>Harleſwood</hi> near <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> ſtood ſtill, and divided it ſelf, ſo that the Bottom remained dry about three miles ſpace.</p>
               <p>And now the King extorting Money, and taking up Carriages and other Neceſſaries intending for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſuppreſs the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells there, who had ſlain <hi>Lord Mortimer</hi> Lord Lieutenant there. And the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> dying about this time, the King ſeized his Goods, in the abſence of his Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Son, which was but <hi>pro tempore,</hi> intending to baniſh him in <hi>perpetuum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which proceedings ſhortly after proved his
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:65606:108"/>
Ruin, for the King now ſailing for <hi>Ireland,</hi> did little good there, but himſelf great harm here. For by this means he gave <hi>Henry</hi> the Baniſhed Son of the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> opportunity to land in <hi>England</hi> for the gaining of his Right. At whoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival ſeveral Lords flocked to him. Their firſt attempt, was againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where they took <hi>Buſſy</hi> the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and <hi>Green,</hi> who the next day were made ſhorter by the heads.</p>
               <p>The King hearing of theſe Stirs return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thought to have nipt them in the Bud, but at his coming he found them ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blown: whereupon he betook himſelf to <hi>Conworth</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Wales,</hi> and afterwards delivered himſelf into the hands of the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> conditionally that if he and eight more, whom he would name, might have honourable Allowance, with the aſſurance of a quiet private Life, that then he would reſign his Crown: from hence he was carried to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and a Parliament was called at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> in his name, who all agreed to the reſignation: and Meſſengers were ſent to the Tower to him with the ſaid In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument (the manner and form where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is ſhewed before in <hi>Edward</hi> the Seconds time) to this Inſtrument the King ſet his

hand and Seal, deſiring that his Coſen <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> might ſucceed him, and thereupon put his Signet Ring on the Dukes hand.</p>
               <p>After this the Definitive Sentence being given in open Parliament, Duke <hi>Henry</hi> riſing from his Seat, made his challenge to the Crown, as followeth,</p>

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:65606:111"/>Preſently after this, the King entered <hi>Scotland,</hi> and ſpoiled the Country, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Return, <hi>Wales</hi> was in Rebellion, under the Command of <hi>Owen Glendour:</hi> of which the King having Intelligence, he turned his March thither, and burnt, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and took ſuch Revenge as that time would permit, and ſo returned with ſuch ſpoil as he had got, <hi>Glendour</hi> being gotten into the inexpugnable <hi>Snowden</hi> hills.</p>
               <p>But the King's Danger was not leſs at home than abroad, for in his Bed there was hidden a <hi>Calthrope</hi> or Engine with three very ſharp Teeth or Spikes, all of them ſet upward for his Deſtruction, but he diſcovered it before he lay down, but the Traytor was never found out.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Glendour</hi> ſtill proceeding in his <hi>Outrages, Edmund</hi> Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi> went againſt him, but with the loſs of about a thouſand of his men in the Attempt, and his own Liberty to boot, being taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and afterwards, either for love or fear, did marry <hi>Glendour</hi>'s Daughter, and was privy and conſenting to <hi>Piercy</hi>'s Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, which followed afterwards.</p>
               <p>About this time were ſeveral Libels diſperſed up and down in Defamation of the King, but the Authors being taken,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65606:111"/>
ſuffer'd death, amongſt whom were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Grey-Fryers: after the Execution of theſe offenders, the King again entered <hi>Wales,</hi> but the cruel Storms there at that time forced his return. And the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> the King's Lieutenant of the North, and <hi>Piercy Hot-Spur</hi> the Earls Son, had better ſucceſs againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who had entered <hi>England,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by weeping Croſs, being overthrown in two Battels by the Earl and his Son, and ſeveral taken Priſoners.</p>
               <p>After this, the King took to Wife Lady <hi>Jane</hi> of <hi>Navar,</hi> Widdow of <hi>John de Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth</hi> Duke of <hi>Britain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and ſhortly after ſeveral Prodigies appeared Prognoſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Piercys</hi> Rebellion, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long after; the firſt of them, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himſelf in open Arms, was Lord <hi>Piercy Hot-Spurr,</hi> who made head about <hi>Cheſter,</hi> to whom repaired the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> their intentions being to enter the Town of <hi>Shrewsbury.</hi> The King ſent for them, promiſing under his hand their ſafe conduct; but they refuſed to go, which cauſed the King with the Prince and other Nobles to march towards them: as ſoon as <hi>Piercy Hot-spur</hi> diſcovered the Royal Standard, he drew out his Army, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of about 14000, to try the Fortune
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:65606:112"/>
of War, which at that time proved very averſe to him, for he and the Earls of <hi>Worcester, Douglas,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Vernon</hi> Barron of <hi>Kinlaton,</hi> and ſeveral others, with 200 Eſquires and Gentlemen of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> that day, or the next, loſs their Lives, with an Incredible number of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers: and on the King's party were ſlain the Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and ten new Knights, all made that morning, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Eſquires and Gentlemen, and about 500 common Soldiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Battel ended, the King marched to <hi>York,</hi> whither he commanded the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> to come, who obeyed his Command and had pardon of Life, but was abridged in Eſtate.</p>
               <p>Whiles things were thus ſetling in the North, news came that <hi>Wales</hi> was ſtill in Rebellion: ſo the Clergy, at the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Metropolitan, granted the King a Subſidy for Maintenance of his Army: and <hi>William de Wilford,</hi> alſo being in the King's Service on the narrow Seas, brought ſome aſſiſtance to his Indigencies, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king 40 Prizes laden with Iron, Oyl, Sope and <hi>Rochel</hi> Wines, to the number of one thouſand Tuns.</p>
               <p>And not long after, a Parliament being called, another Subſidy was granted, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:65606:112"/>
the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was again reſtored to his Poſſeſſions: preſently after this, came a Troop of Weſtern men, who brought to the King three forein Lords and 20 Knights of note, Priſoners from <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> where they alſo ſlew the Lord of <hi>Castile</hi> and ſeveral of his men, which Lord formerly had burnt <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and thinking to have done ſo here, was by theſe Plebeans put by his purpoſe; for which good Service the King gave them ſtore of Gold.</p>
               <p>And now the King calling Three Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one after another, for Money, could get none: the chief Oppoſer was <hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Earl Marſhal, who drew <hi>Richard Scroop</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York</hi> into a Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt the King, and the Earl of <hi>Westmerland,</hi> pretending to ſide with them, enſnared them both in his Gin, and preſented them to the King, who cauſed both their Heads to be ſtruck off, although <hi>Weſtmerland</hi> had promiſed them their Lives. And now the King began again to purſue the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and Lord <hi>Bardolf</hi> (who were ſuppoſed privy to Earl Marſhals Conſpiracy) with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of 37000 Men, whereupon they fled into <hi>Scotland:</hi> the King ſeeing this, took <hi>Barwick</hi> by battering down a Tower in the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:65606:113"/>
Wall, with a great Gun, the firſt that was uſed in <hi>England,</hi> and took <hi>Alnwick,</hi> and all other Caſtles belonging to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> And from hence mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to <hi>Wales,</hi> he expected the like good Fortune there, but ſuch a ſudded Rage of Waters in <hi>Wales</hi> came ſo faſt down upon his Army, that he was forced to return, 50 Waynes laden with Treaſure, and other Carriages being deſtroyed by the Rage thereof.</p>
               <p>After this, another Parliament being called, they granted a Subſidy, being ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wearied with the King's Importunity than out of any good Will to him. <hi>Anno</hi> 1407. being the next year after, there was ſo great a Plague in <hi>England,</hi> that in ſhort ſpace it deſtroyed 30000 in <hi>London,</hi> and multitudes elſewhere in the Realm: and the year after was a great Froſt that held 15 Weeks.</p>
               <p>All this while <hi>Glendour</hi> continuing his Rebellion in <hi>Wales.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland</hi> and Lord <hi>Bardolf</hi> leaving <hi>Wales</hi> (into which they had eſcaped) and coming to raiſe Forces in the North, were met and encountred by Sir <hi>Thomas Rook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> the Sheriff of <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> who flew the Earl, and gave the Lord <hi>Bardolf</hi> a wound, of which he died.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:65606:113"/>After this, the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the King for Aid againſt the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> had his Requeſt anſwered: and preſently after <hi>Orleance</hi> ſending for Aid againſt <hi>Burgandy,</hi> and promiſing greater matters than the other, it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him alſo, to the great wonder of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: and now the Lord <hi>Hail,</hi> Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> laying a Siege to a certain ſtrong place in <hi>Gaſcoign,</hi> with other Lords, and about 4000 Men of Arms, were driven from thence by Sir <hi>John Blunt</hi> with 300 Soldiers, and 12 of the Principalleſt, and about 120 Gentlemen were then taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; but the King lived not to ſee the Fortune and Carriage of theſe Wars.

Sawtree, William James, Thomas Brightwell, William Haulam, Ralph Greenburſt,</hi> and <hi>John Schut</hi> were burnt and ſtrangled in St. <hi>Gyles</hi>'s Fields: after this the King reſtored the Son of Lord <hi>Piercy Hot-Spur</hi> to his Blood and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's Honour of Earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> and preſently after ſent Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to <hi>France,</hi> to demand the Dutchies of <hi>Normandy, Aquitain, Guyen</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> but in deriſion to his Demands; the <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> ſent him a Tun of Tennice Balls, as Bullets moſt fit for his tender hands. The King diſguſted here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, preparing for Warrs, the <hi>French</hi> made the <hi>Scots,</hi> their Friends, to invade <hi>Englands</hi> marches, which accordingly they did in ſuch a violent manner, that the King ſcarce knew which Kingdom to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with firſt, but at length it was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>France:</hi> the Clergy giving a Tenth, and the Temporal Lords their Aid of 346 Men at arms, and 552 Archers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome 10 Ships, and to keep back the <hi>Scots,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mſreivil</hi> was ſent againſt them, who in a Skirmiſh took 360 of them Priſoners, and great ſpoil.</p>

               <p>Hereupon <hi>Charles</hi> ſent a million of Gold out of <hi>France</hi> to the Lords <hi>Scroop, Gray</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> (all three in eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al favour with King <hi>Henry</hi>) to betray or murther him, before he arrived in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy;</hi> which they (O the prevalency of Gold) intended to have put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but being diſcovered the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King intended to have put to Sea, they were all three beheaded.</p>
               <p>And ſo the King embarked for <hi>France,</hi> and landed near <hi>Harflew,</hi> commanding his Army that they ſhould do no violence to Churches, Church-men, Women or Children; and ſo advanced towards the Town, and laid Siege to it, which ſhortly after was yielded to him, and he turned out the <hi>French,</hi> and Peopled the Town with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Artizans; from hence he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 2000 Horſe and 13000 Foot, through the Countries of <hi>Caux</hi> and <hi>Ewe</hi> towards <hi>Callis<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

ſhed Woods, pulled down Bridges, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried all Victuals out of the Country where he intended to paſs) and his Soldiers growing ſick and faint for want of Victuals, he therefore reſolved to march back to <hi>Callis.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>French</hi> upon this Advantage think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſurprize the King, near <hi>Azin</hi> Court pitched their Banner Royal, their Hoſt conſiſting of 150000 Horſe, and 10000 Men at Arms, Princes, Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Knights.

                  </hi> the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and ſome few others: but of the <hi>French</hi> fell that day 4000 Princes, Nobles, Knights and Eſquires, beſides 10000 Common Soldiers; and ſo many Priſoners taken that they far exceeded the

Conquerors, wherefore the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to kill them all, leaſt they ſhould riſe up againſt them. From thence the King marched to <hi>Callis,</hi> and ſo took Ship for <hi>England,</hi> landing at <hi>Dover,</hi> where he was received with great Triumph, and at his entrance into <hi>London,</hi> was preſented with 1000 pounds in Gold, and two Gold Baſons worth 500 pounds.</p>
               <p>Not long after, <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the Emperor arrived in <hi>England,</hi> deſiring a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which would not be granted; and ſo concluded a Peace between himſelf and <hi>England</hi> (and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the honourable Order of Knight-hood of the Garter from King <hi>Henry</hi>) he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. And now the King of <hi>France</hi> having a Navy waſting on the Seas with many Bravadoes; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet under the Command of <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> battered, ſunk and took the moſt of them, and ſent the three great Carracks of <hi>Genoa</hi> to <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Burgundy</hi> now ſiding with <hi>France</hi> againſt <hi>England,</hi> the King thereupon called a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and a Subſidy and tenth was granted him for the maintenance of the Wars againſt <hi>France:</hi> but all not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient for defraying ſo vaſt a charge, he was forced to pawn his Crown, and ſell

               <p>About this time the <hi>Scots</hi> laying Siege againſt <hi>Barwick</hi> and <hi>Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Preſently after a Parliament was called by the Protector's Authority, for raiſing Money for the Wars: in which Parliament Sir <hi>John Old-Caſtle,</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> (who held the opinion of Dr. <hi>Wickliff</hi>) was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and hanged in St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s Fields, being burnt alſo whileſt he was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:65606:117"/>The King at this time laid againſt the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Fallais,</hi> which after a while was ſurrendred upon certain Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and after this he divided his Army into ſeveral parts, under the Command of Himſelf and Nobles, who wan ſeveral Caſtles here and there; he with his party laid Siege to <hi>Roan,</hi> which after ſix months Siege was forced to Surrender, there being famiſhed in the Town during the Siege 50000, and 12000 Starvelings turned out of the Town who died in Ditches. He cauſed the Burgeſſes there to pay him 356000 Crowns towards his Expences in the Siege, and likewiſe to ſwear Fealty to him and his Succeſſors.

               <p>Preſently after the Surrender of this place, about 40 other Towns and places of note did yield themſelves to the King: and now the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſought to make Peace, but it was denyed, King <hi>Henry</hi> following on now to make an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and entire Conqueſt, which ſhortly after he effected, a Flood-Gate being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him for accompliſhing of the ſame, by reaſon of ſome affronts offered by the <hi>Dauphin</hi> to his Mother the Queen,

who impatient of wrongs, raiſed Forces, and with the help of the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Regent of <hi>France,</hi> which civil Broils made well for King <hi>Henry,</hi> for Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſought with him it was granted with theſe Conditions, that the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and all its Rights after the Death of the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> and his Queen, ſhould remain to King <hi>Henry</hi> and his Heirs for ever; whereupon he married Lady <hi>Catherine</hi> Daughter to King <hi>Charles;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Sallique</hi> Law of <hi>France</hi> at this time was made void, but the Pope being ſollicited to confirm <hi>Henry</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> would not condeſcend to it.</p>
               <p>Upon the Sealing and Swearing the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove mentioned Articles, <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> did Homage to King <hi>Henry,</hi> who was then Stiled and Proclaimed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>France;</hi> and kept his Court at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> for a time, Parliaments being then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led which confirmed all things, the Nobles all ſwearing to be true to King <hi>Henry,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Dauphin</hi> and his party who were in Rebellion, and in the laſt Parliament had Sentence of Diſinheritance pronounced againſt him, and, in the Court of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> all things were ſealed with the Seal of King <hi>Henry.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Windſor.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis King was Crowned at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> being but about 8 months old, and a Parliament being called and a Subſidy granted; that the regal Chair in the Houſe might not ſtand empty, thither the Queen did carry the young Prince, and ſate with him in her Lap, he ſpeaking to the Houſe in anothers Tongue. And now the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in <hi>France</hi> were various, Fortune ſometimes ſmiling on the <hi>French,</hi> and other ſometimes on the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> Regent of <hi>France</hi> deſired to enter Battel with the <hi>French,</hi> which accordingly was perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the <hi>Vernoil</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> were beaten, and about 5000 of them ſlain, beſides many taken Priſoners.</p>
               <p>During theſe proceedings in <hi>France, James</hi> the young King of <hi>Scots,</hi> (who had caſually been taken Priſoner at Sea in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fifths time) was ſet at Liberty in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:65606:119"/>
                  <hi>England</hi> thereby to draw the Scots off from Aiding the <hi>French,</hi> not long after Duke <hi>Humphry</hi> the Protector was married to <hi>Jaqueline</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> her Husband being then living, which cauſed the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> to forſake the Regent in <hi>France:</hi> and now Factions breeding in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> the Regent left <hi>France</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the dangers at home, which he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily performed, and then with the Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> and freſh Forces returned again to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1428<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unto <hi>All-Hallon-Tide</hi> after, fell ſuch abundance of <hi>Rain,</hi> that not only Hay but Corn alſo was diſtroyed. About this time, at the Regent's Return into <hi>France,</hi> Siege was laid unto <hi>Orleance,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was ſlain, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Siege continued. And <hi>Charles</hi> the young <hi>French</hi> King being very penſive not knowing how to remedy this Miſchief likely to enſue. At <hi>Chinon</hi> a young Maid called <hi>Joane</hi> of <hi>Loraine,</hi> a ſheeperdeſs, appeared to him, bidding him be of good Courage, for God had ſent her to deliver the Realm, and ſo going to <hi>Bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:65606:120"/>
at that Brunt: and for ſome ſhort ſpace after this, the looſing and taking of Towns was interchangeable: but <hi>Joan</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alanzon</hi> ſtill proceeding in their good fortunes, near <hi>Jergeaux</hi> they fought the Lord <hi>Talbot,</hi> taking him and ſeveral Nobles Priſoners, and killing about 1000 of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they not looſing above 600. Hereupon ſeveral Towns Revolted from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf (who before had kept in) now Iſſued out in Armes, thinking to have recovered <hi>Paris,</hi> but he was diſapointed of his hopes by the Regent: and now the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Siege to <hi>Champaign, Joan</hi> the Martial Maid coming to it's Reſcue, was taken and ſent to <hi>Roan,</hi> and there Burnt for a Witch, which did not a little diſmay the <hi>French:</hi> but ſucceſs proving ſtill various, it was thought that King <hi>Henry's</hi> preſence in <hi>France</hi> would be a great diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Carrolines:</hi> hereupon the King with the Company of the two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Cardinals, <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and other Nobles ſailed into <hi>France Anno.</hi> 1432, and at <hi>Paris</hi> by the Cardinal of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> he was Crowned King of <hi>France:</hi> yet <hi>Charles</hi> eſteemed himſelf not the leſs a King for all this: the King having thus taken poſſeſſion of <hi>France,</hi> not long after
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:65606:120"/>
took his farewel of it, his Return was by <hi>Roan</hi> and ſo over Land to <hi>Callis,</hi> and thence to <hi>England</hi> again: and now the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers beginning to be weary of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and diſcontented with their Wages, fell to Mutiny at <hi>Paris,</hi> for which the Regent caſhiered 110, and chopt of the heads of four of the Principalleſt of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1435, the Theames was ſo fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, that the Merchants which came to the <hi>Thames</hi> Mouth, were forced to be carryed to <hi>London</hi> by Land.</p>
               <p>And now after ſeveral Changeable Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes in <hi>France,</hi> at length the Regent dyed, the news of whoſe death coming to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> was ſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but <hi>Paris</hi> was loſt before his Arrival in <hi>France:</hi> and after ſeveral Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to beſiege <hi>Callis,</hi> to which place the new Regent drew his Army, but King <hi>Henry</hi> hearing hereof, and fearing the worſt, ſent the Protector with a great Fleet againſt the <hi>French;</hi> at whoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach they all ran away, and ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector Settling the State of <hi>Callis,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great honour. But this new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, performing little or nothing in <hi>France,</hi> he Returned for <hi>England;</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:65606:121"/>
Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> went in his place: but, he after a ſhort ſpace dying, the Duke of <hi>York</hi> went again, and, at his Return into <hi>France,</hi> proſſered ſeveral times to fight the <hi>French</hi> King, who never durſt undertake to joyn Battel with him. Not long after this the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> was ſet at Liberty who had been Priſoner ever ſince the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel at <hi>Azin</hi> Court, which was above 26 yeares before, his Ranſom was 300000 Crowns, the Protector was much againſt his Releaſment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1438. All the Lions in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> dyed: and this ſame year was held the Council at <hi>Florence,</hi> being the 16 General Council, <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pope.</p>
               <p>Julythe 18. <hi>Anno</hi> 1440. The Poſtern of <hi>London</hi> by Eaſt Smith-field againſt the Tower of <hi>London</hi> ſunk by Night: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 2 years after a Conteſt fell between the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> his Uncle, and the Duke's Lady was accus'd by the Cardinal <hi>Henry Chicely</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for Witch-craft, as if by Art Magick ſhe went about to take away the King's Life: and ſhe was forced to ſatisfy publickly for that wickedneſs ſhe had not attempted, though others that were
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65606:121"/>
guilty, in their very Sufferings excuſed the Dutcheſs of it. Yet notwithſtanding ſhe did Pennance, going, the firſt day from Temple-Bar down <hi>Fleetſtret,</hi> with a wax Taper in her hand, to <hi>Pauls,</hi> where ſhe offered her Taper to the Altar: the next day but one, ſhe went through <hi>Bridge</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet and <hi>Grace</hi> Church Street to <hi>Leaden</hi>-Hall, and ſo to <hi>Chriſt</hi>-Church by Allgate, and two days after ſhe went through <hi>Cheapſide</hi> to St. <hi>Michaels</hi> in Cornhil, in form aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Now the Affairs ſtill various in <hi>France,</hi> at length a Truce was concluded for 18 Moneths, and hopes of perpetual Amity, grounded upon a Match Contracted by <hi>William de la Pole</hi> Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> for the King with <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to <hi>Renate</hi> Duke of <hi>Angiers,</hi> and Titular King of <hi>Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Naples</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but this Match proved inauſpicious to the King, for by it he loſt his <hi>Friends</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and Revenues in <hi>France:</hi> and not long after all was Ruled by the Queen and <hi>Suffolk</hi> and their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices; and a Parliament being called the Duke of <hi>Yorks</hi> Commiſſion was revoked, and <hi>Henery Beaufort</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> was ſent Regent into <hi>France:</hi> And now began the King's Miſerys to approach, for in the Parliament at St. <hi>Edmundsbury,</hi> the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65606:122"/>
Protector through the Queen's means (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the King,) was Arreſted of high Treaſon, and before he came to any Tryal he was Murthered in his Bed, with Pillowes, as it was thought: and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> the other Prop of the Kingdom lived not long after him, after whoſe death, the Affaires both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were carryed on very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Queens chief Favourite, is made Duke, which paſſages diſpleaſing the people, <hi>Richard Plantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> begun to think how theſe diſtempers might work well on his ſide for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Crown: whereupon hetook ſhipping for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſtill the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Commotions there, which he quickly effected, and there layd the foundation of his firſt plots.

               <p>The 23 of the King, on Candlemas Eve, in diverſe places of <hi>England,</hi> were heard

               <p>And now the Duke of <hi>York</hi> ſhortly after procured <hi>Adam Mollins</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> Keeper of the Privy Seal, (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pillar of the Kingdom) to be Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by the Seamen at <hi>Portſmouth.</hi>

               <p>After this the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> was Murthered by his own Tenants, and Lord <hi>Say</hi> Treaſure of <hi>England,</hi> and his Son in

               <p>Theſe Stirs were no ſooner over but the Duke of <hi>York</hi> arrived in <hi>England,</hi> leaving <hi>Ireland,</hi> who at his firſt approach impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned ſeveral Nobles in <hi>Ludlow</hi> Caſtle, but many of the Peers ſided with him; now the King (as it was time) began to rouſe up his Spirits, marching towards the Duke then in <hi>Wales,</hi> who hearing of the King's march fled into <hi>Kent,</hi> and at <hi>Brent</hi>-Heath encamped: of which the King having intelligence he ſteared his Courſe that way, and ſending Meſſengers to the Duke to demand the Reaſons of theſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, he perceiving the King too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

               <p>And now ſome hopes ariſing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> again, the Lord <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> and ſome others were thereupon ſent into <hi>France,</hi> who at firſt were very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful in their Deſigns; but the Lord <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot</hi> being ſlain, the <hi>French</hi> regained all again, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt all <hi>Aquitain:</hi> after they had poſſeſſed it about three hundred years.

               <p>The next day the Duke of <hi>York</hi> and Earls of <hi>Salisbury</hi> and <hi>Warwick</hi> marched to <hi>London</hi> with the King, and in his name ſummoned a Parliament, by whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority the Duke of <hi>York</hi> was eſtabliſhed Protector of <hi>England, Salisbury</hi> Lord Chancelor, and <hi>Warwick</hi> Captain of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis:</hi> but it was not long before they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain diſplaced.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> by reaſon of theſe inteſtine Broils took their Advantage, making ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inroads on the Coaſts of <hi>England,</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Mayor Bayliffs and ſeveral other Officers of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> and burnt <hi>Foway,</hi> and ſeveral other Towns in <hi>Devonſhire.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1458, there was a Fray in <hi>Fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>street,</hi> between the men of the Court and the inhabitants of the ſaid Street; in which Fray the Queens Attorny was ſlain, for which Fact the King committed the Governours of <hi>Cliffords, Furnivals</hi> and <hi>Barnards</hi>-Inn to Priſon; and <hi>William Taylor</hi> Alderman of the Ward, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others were ſent to <hi>Windſor</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>

               <p>And now a ſeeming reconcilement was concluded on between the King with his <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> and the <hi>Yorkiſts,</hi> but it had not long continuance: for the <hi>Yorkiſts,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of ſome Afronts offered to the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> by ſome of the King's Servants, drew to an head again; but their Intentions being diſcovered by one <hi>Andrew Trollop,</hi> they all thereupon diſperced themſelves.</p>

               <p>KING <hi>Edward</hi> was Crowned at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> but his Carriages towards the Citizens at his firſt entrance, made them repent their forwardneſs in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half againſt King <hi>Henry:</hi> and hearing of <hi>Henry</hi>'s preparations in the North, he marched toward <hi>Pontefrack</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> giving the Lord <hi>Fitzwalter</hi> charge of the paſſage at <hi>Ferry Bridg</hi> nigh <hi>Pontefract,</hi> where the ſaid Lord and ſeveral of his men were ſlain: ſhortly after the Armies drew into a plain between the Towns of <hi>Towton</hi> and <hi>Saxton,</hi> the King's Army conſiſting of 48660, and <hi>Henry</hi>'s of 60000 men, the Fight was bloody and continued 10 hours, but at laſt the <hi>Lancaſtrians</hi> not able to gain-ſtand <hi>Edward</hi>'s Forces, they betook themſelves to their Heels, leaving the glory of the day to King <hi>Edward,</hi> there was ſlain that day being <hi>Palm-Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the 29 of <hi>March,</hi> ſeveral Nobles, as <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,

John</hi> Lord <hi>Clifford, John</hi> Lord <hi>Nevil,</hi> and <hi>Leonard</hi> Lord <hi>Wells,</hi> and ſeveral other perſons of Quality, to the Number of 357, and in all there was ſlain about 35091.</p>
               <p>This doleful News coming to <hi>Henry,</hi> he with his Queen and Son fled into <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where they were honourably received by King <hi>James,</hi> to whoſe Siſter not long after the Prince was married, and now after theſe paſſages in <hi>Scotland</hi> the Queen ſailed into <hi>France</hi> to ſeek Aide, where ſhe got more men then her Coffers would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> in the mean time road Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to <hi>London,</hi> and was again Proclaimed King, and a Parliament ſhortly after being called, They diſinherited <hi>Henry,</hi> his Queen and Son, and about 43 Nobles, and others; and now the Queen returning into <hi>Scotland</hi> with her <hi>French</hi> Fleet, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards making for <hi>England</hi> her Fleet was <hi>Scattered</hi> by a Tempeſt, ſo that her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and She were left ſolely to the Aide of the <hi>Scots,</hi> who marching into <hi>England</hi> as far as the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> prepared to meet them, but making an halt at <hi>York,</hi> he ſent the Lord <hi>Montacute</hi> with forces to oppoſe them; who was encountered on <hi>Hedgley Moore</hi> by the Lords <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:65606:128"/>
Lord <hi>Montacute</hi> gave the foyl, taking Sir <hi>Ralph Percy,</hi> and ſeveral others being ſlain; and growing proud of this Victory he aſſail'd King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Camp at <hi>Hexham,</hi> where, after great ſlaughter, he took the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> and other three Lords, and one Knight, which were all beheaded: whereupon <hi>Henry</hi> fled into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and afterwards coming into <hi>England</hi> in diſguiſe, he was taken, and having his feet tyed to the ſtirrups, and his guilt ſpurs taken off his heels, he was then committed Priſoner to the Tower of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after King <hi>Edward</hi> called a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and Enacted ſeveral good Laws, eſpecially againſt pride in Apparrel; and now he begins to think of a wife, whereupon the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was ſent to ſollicite a Marriage between the King and Lady <hi>Bona</hi> Daughter to <hi>Lewes</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> and all things being well approved of by the Lady and her Friends, the Earl Returned; before whoſe Return the King had ſet his Affections on the Lady <hi>Elizabeth Gray</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Mother was <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quelline</hi> Daughter to <hi>Peter</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> to whom ſhortly after he was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> took great diſtaſt thereat, thinking himſelf hereby abuſed,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:65606:128"/>
and endeavoured afterwards to uphold King <hi>Henry's</hi> Cauſe, drawing to his Aſſiſtance ſome Nobles and Forein Princes; and upon theſe diſcontents, ſome of the Commons roſe under the Command of one <hi>Robert Hildern,</hi> intending to gave ſeized on <hi>York,</hi> from which place they were beaten back by the Lord <hi>Montacute</hi> preſident thereof, and their Leader be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</p>
               <p>Yet the Commons not diſmai'd hereat, choſe <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Fitzhughs</hi> Son, and Sir <hi>Henery Nevil</hi> Son to the Lord <hi>Latimer,</hi> but they being but young, made choice of Sir <hi>John Coniers</hi> a valliant Knight, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their march for <hi>London:</hi> of which the King having notice, he made <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> General, and Sir <hi>Richard Herbert</hi> his Brother aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant to him.</p>
               <p>And now the Northern forces draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near <hi>Northampton,</hi> the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Herbert</hi> with 2000 Horſe fell in the Rear of them, but were repulſed and loſt moſt of their Men: afterwards the Armies meeting near <hi>Banbury,</hi> ſome diſtaſt being then taken by the Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> at the Earl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> the Kings General, he thereupon withdrew his Archers upon which occaſion <hi>Pembrook</hi> loſt the

               <p>And now King <hi>Edward</hi> rid Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly to <hi>London,</hi> having King <hi>Henry</hi> ſtill with him: and about this very time landed Queen <hi>Margaret Henry</hi>'s Wife, and her Son <hi>Edward</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the loſs at <hi>Barnet</hi> field, they took Aſylum at the Abby of <hi>Ceerne,</hi> to which place the Lords that fled from <hi>Barnet</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, who comforted the Queens heart with future hopes: here forces repairing to them they flye from place to place, and at length fought King <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Teuxsbury</hi> where three or four of the Chief of them, as the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Somerſets</hi> Brother were ſlain, and 3000 men beſides: and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> heir to <hi>Henry</hi> was taken, and ſeveral Lords taking Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary at <hi>Tewxsbury,</hi> were nevertheleſs haled thence and beheaded: and it is reported Prince <hi>Edward</hi> was baſely murthered by the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and ſome of King

               <p>And ſhortly after King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the heart by Crookt-back <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> who, as is ſhewed before was a main Inſtrument in Prince <hi>Edward's</hi> Murther; it is recorded of King <hi>Henry</hi> that he had an honeſt mind, a comely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, and was more like a Saint than a King: now Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> being ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed by her Father, went beyond Seas to him and there languiſhed away her dayes.</p>
               <p>And after this all <hi>Henrys</hi> Friends being either baniſhed or put to Death, <hi>Edward</hi> was then at quiet, and calling a Parliament, all King <hi>Henry's</hi> Laws were Abrogated.

               </p>
               <p>About this time one <hi>John Huſs</hi> ſuffered the flames, on <hi>Tower</hi> hill; for the profeſſion of a good Faith: and now, all things being ſetled, King <hi>Edward</hi> followed his pleaſure, and being on his Progreſs in <hi>Warwickſhire,</hi> he chanced to hunt in the Park of one <hi>Thomas Burdet</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And in thoſe catching times a Jeſt of a <hi>Mercer</hi> in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> telling his Son if he would ply his Book, he ſhould be Heir to the Crown, (meaning his own houſe that had that ſign) coſt him his Life.</p>
               <p>After this the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> being falſely Attainted and Condemned by Parliament, he was ſhortly after drowned in a Butt of <hi>Malmſy</hi> in the Tower.</p>
               <p>And <hi>James</hi> King of Scots about this time ſent into <hi>England</hi> to dare King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>

               <p>After this the <hi>French</hi> breaking the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Peace, by the <hi>Dauphin's</hi> Marriage to Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Auſtrich,</hi> Grand Child to the Emperour <hi>Frederick:</hi> the King hereupon intended War againſt them, but was prevented by Death.

               <p>This <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth was King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was Son to <hi>Richard Plantaginet</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> by his Wife, Daughter to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Nevil</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Reign on <hi>Monday</hi> the fourth day of <hi>March, Anno</hi> 1460. and Reigned 22 years 1, Moneth and 5 dayes, and was the 36 Sole Monarch of <hi>England.</hi> He dyed of a Surfeit at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on <hi>Friday</hi> the 9 day of <hi>April Anno</hi> 1483, being the 40. year of his Age, and 23, of his Reign.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fifth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis King was never Crowned, for at the very firſt, his Uncle, the Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> began to think of depoſing him, drawing to his ſide the Duke of <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and Lord <hi>Haſtings,</hi> they reſolve forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to remove all the Queen's Friends from the King, and to compaſs their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, they perſwade the Queen that her ſon the King might come to <hi>London</hi> to his Coronation, accompanied only with ſome few of his friends, which ſhe (little ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting what they aimed at) eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcended unto: and now they proceed to the taking of their Prey, impriſoning the Lord <hi>Rivers,</hi> the Queens Brother, at <hi>Northampton,</hi> they then haſted after the King to <hi>Story-Stratford,</hi> whither he was gone on his way for <hi>London:</hi> and here they made bold, in the King's preſence, to arreſt the Lord <hi>Richard Woodvile,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Grey,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Wagham;</hi> and carried the King and all his company back to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton,</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:65606:133"/>
there diſplacing ſuch of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as they thought fit; and putting others (whom they pleaſed) in their places.</p>
               <p>Having thus far proceeded in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, the perfidious Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> took upon himſelf the Order and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the young King, and ſent Lord <hi>Richard Woodvile,</hi> and the other two Knights to <hi>Pontefract</hi> Caſtle in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> where in Concluſion they were beheaded. The Queen, having notice of theſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, betook her ſelf with her Children to Sanctuary in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> where ſhortly after the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> then Lord Chancelour, delivered her the Great Seal; but afterwards conſidering of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he might incur hereby, ſent for it again.</p>
               <p>And now the Dukes of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Buckingham</hi> coming to <hi>London</hi> with the King, his Majeſty was received with great Joy, and lodged in the Biſhop's Pallace, where all the Lords were ſworn to him, and there the ſubtile Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelf ſo reverently towards the King, that the next Council he was choſen Protector. At this Council the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> was reproved for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs in giving up the great Seal to the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:65606:134"/>
Queen, and was deprived of the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorſhip, and Dr. <hi>Ruſſel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> put in his place.</p>
               <p>All things thus proceeding, according to the Protector's mind, he proceeds further in his wicked Plot, making ſuch a cunning Apology to the Council, for getting the young Duke of <hi>York</hi> (the King's Brother) out of Sanctuary, that they all (ſuſpecting no harm) conſented to him, and agreed that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> ſhould repair to the Queen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire her delivery of the young Prince; and if denied, then to bring him away by force: and after a long conference between the Queen and Biſhop, at length, with tears, ſhe delivered the Child into their hands, from whence he was carried into the Star-Chamber to <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> who took him in his Arms with much ſeeming Joy, and gave him a <hi>Judas</hi> kiſs.</p>
               <p>So having got what he deſired, he and <hi>Buckingham</hi> made Covenants between themſelves, that <hi>Glouceſter</hi> ſhould be King, and that <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſhould have the Earldom of <hi>Hartford,</hi> and great part of the King's Treaſure; and to blind the People of their intentions, ſeveral Lords from ſeveral parts of the Realm were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, to deviſe things for <hi>Edward</hi>'s Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:65606:134"/>
at whoſe appearance the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and <hi>Buckingham</hi> withdrew into <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops-gate</hi> Street, to contrive the contrary.</p>
               <p>Soon after ſeveral Lords repaired to the Tower, to conſider further of the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the time drew ſo near that all things were in readineſs for it, but not the Protector comes in amongſt them, ſeeming to be very merry, excuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he had been ſo long from them, and deſired to withdraw a little: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 2 hours after he came in with a ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and frowning Countenance, and took his place, and after a while he thus ſpake:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What are they worthy of</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that compaſs and imagine my Deſtruction?</hi> to whom Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> made Anſwer, That they were worthy to be puniſhed as Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: <hi>That is</hi> (quoth the Duke) <hi>yonder Sorcereſs my Brother's Wife</hi> (meaning the Queen) <hi>and that other Witch of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> Shoar's <hi>Wife:</hi> At theſe words the Lords of the Council were much diſmayed; and hereupon the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> ſaid, Surely they would not do ſo; but the Protector anſwered, and ſaid, <hi>I tell thee, they have done ſo, and that I will make good on thy Body, Traytor:</hi> and ſo giving a clap on the Table with his hand, in came as many men in Harneſs as the Room
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65606:135"/>
would hold, and all the Lords were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſome to one Room and ſome to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> within three hours after was beheaded on a Log before the Chappel Door in the Tower.</p>
               <p>And now ſending for ſeveral able Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens into the Tower after Dinner, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them that the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> would have deſtroyed him and the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and ſo diſmiſſed the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and cauſed Proclamation to be made of the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And not long after the Sheriffs of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> were ſent to ſeize of <hi>Jane Shoars</hi> goods, which amounted to 300 marks, and ſhe afterward was forced to do Pennance to her great ſhame: and now the Protector fought to ſtrike whileſt the Iron was hot, and ſo ſent for the Lord Mayor <hi>Edmund Shaw,</hi> and made him acquainted with the Deſign, who in hopes of Honour promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to draw the Citizens that way: and means, how to accompliſh this Deſign, was to get ſome able Miniſters to Preach that King <hi>Edward</hi> the IV was a Baſtard, and that all his Children were Baſtards, and ſo to ſet up the praiſes of the wicked Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector; thereby to ſeduce the People who are naturally apt to liſten to Novelties: and for this purpoſe Dr. <hi>Shaw</hi> the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65606:135"/>
Brother, and Dr. <hi>Pincker</hi> were the Men pitched upon, who performed the Task very dexterouſly, and it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to think what waverings and doubtings this cauſed amongſt the People: but the two Doctors felt God's Judgments for this Offence afterwards.</p>
               <p>Theſe things being thus bruited abroad the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> ſhortly after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to Guild-Hall in <hi>London,</hi> to which place the Mayor, Aldermen and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the City were come, where he made a Learned Apology to them for the Election of <hi>Richard</hi> Protector to be King: the People here at were all mute and anſwered not one word, but being asked thrice of their Opinions herein, and in a manner threatned to it, at length they drew down into the Hall, and began to whiſper among themſelves, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a great Company of Apprentices and the Dukes Servants prepared for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ruſhed in at their Backs, Crying <hi>King Richard:</hi> and hereupon it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to be the Cry of the whiſpering Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and ſo the Aſſembly being diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for this time, they were all required to meet <hi>Buckingham</hi> the next day at <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nards</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Thames-Street,</hi> at which place the Protector then Lodged: and after
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:65606:136"/>
the Aſſembly was come the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> made the Protector, with their (as he ſaid) Election of him, to be King: at which words <hi>Richard</hi> (as though he had been ignorant) looked very ſtrangely on them, and denied to accept of that (he ſo much coveted) the Crown: but <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> making himſelf the Mouth of the Aſſembly, told him, If he would not accept of it, they would make choice of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Noble man: whereupon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor (ſeeming as it were to have that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon him he moſt deſired) accepted of it; promiſing more to the People then, in a quarter of an hour, than he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all his Life. And ſo at this time <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> was depoſed, and he and his Brother, about two months after, were murthered in the Tower.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Edward</hi> the V. (though never Crowned) was accounted King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland:</hi> he was the eldeſt Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the IV, by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his Queen, Daughter to Sir <hi>Richard Woodvile</hi> Earl of <hi>Rivers,</hi> by <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilana</hi> his Wife, Dutcheſs of <hi>Bedford.</hi> He began his Reign on <hi>Friday</hi> the 9 day of <hi>April, Anno</hi> 1483, and reigned two months and thirteen days, and was the 37 ſole Monarch of <hi>England.</hi> He with his
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:65606:136"/>
younger Brother the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> were ſmothered to Death in their Beds, in the Tower with Pillows, about the lattter end of <hi>July, Anno</hi> 1483, being the firſt and laſt year of his Reign, and the 12 of his Age: Their Murtherers were <hi>Miles For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt</hi> and <hi>John Deighton,</hi> Servants to Sir <hi>James Tirrel,</hi> who was imployed for this purpoſe by the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> their Uncle, then King of <hi>England:</hi> their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were buried deep in the Ground un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Stare-caſe in the Tower, and being afterwards taken up again, none knows where they were laid.</p>

                  <p>Of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PReſently after his Election, as is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, a Parliament was called, and he thereby confirmed King, and the Crown intailed upon him and his Heirs, and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his Son made Heir apparent; but againſt his Coronation (guilty Conſciences accuſing themſelves)
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65606:137"/>
he being ſtill in Fear, he ſent for five thouſand Soldiers out of the North, under the Command of <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Ridſdale,</hi> to come up to <hi>London:</hi> and before his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (which was very glorious) he ſet at Liberty the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>York</hi> and the Lord <hi>Stanly,</hi> but continued Biſhop <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Impriſonment, whereupon the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſending a Letter to the King in Biſhop <hi>Mortons</hi> behalf, he was thereupon delivered to the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham,</hi> who ſent him to his Caſtle of <hi>Brecknock</hi> in <hi>Wales;</hi> and after the Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was over, the King took his Progreſs to <hi>Glouceſter:</hi> and from thence ſent a Letter by one <hi>John Green</hi> to Sir <hi>Robert Brackenbury</hi> Lieutenant of the Tower to deſtroy the two young Princes, who dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſo foul a Murther, Sir <hi>James Tirrel</hi> a Man of ſmall eſtate, (for what will not Wealth and Honour prompt a man to) being promiſed great things by the King, undertook the Murther, and for executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, he imployed two Bloody Varlets who about Midnight ſmothered the two Innocent Princes with pillows and the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-bed. But God's Judgments attended theſe murderers: and the King's mind ever after was fill'd with Horror and Fear, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his hand conſtantly on his Dagger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:65606:137"/>And now the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to diſlike the King, for he had denied the Duke the Earldom of <hi>Hartford,</hi> which was promiſed by <hi>Richard</hi> before he got the Crown: whereupon the Duke (of whoſe Intentions Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> was privy) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came to the Court, but ſeeking how to depoſe him (whoſe main Inſtrument he was in exalting) to bring this buſineſs to effect, a Marriage was propounded by him, and ſollicited afterwards by others, to the Queen and the Counteſs of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> between <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> Heir to the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth</hi> the Queens eldeſt Daughter, Heir to the Houſe of <hi>York,</hi> which match was well reſented by all parties, for hereby the Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York</hi> being United, the Quarrel in which ſo much Blood had been ſpilt would be ended.</p>
               <p>Upon this Account Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> went over into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and did the Earl of <hi>Richmond</hi> (then in Baniſhment) very good Service; now the Earl having intelligence of theſe Proceedings, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diſcloſed it to the Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> who promiſed him his Aſſiſtance: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he ſent into <hi>England</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> to make him acquainted with his preparation for <hi>England;</hi> but in the mean

time, the King heard ſome whiſperings of this Plot, and therefore ſent for <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to repair to the Court, who refuſed to go, immediately preparing for War, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King: at which news the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Dorſet</hi> left his Sanctuary and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed an Army in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Courtny</hi> another in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Guilford</hi> one in <hi>Kent.</hi> The King rouſed up at this news, took his march towards <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> intending to encounter the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> (the head firſt,) who hearing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of made out to meet the King accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a great number of Wild-<hi>Welſh</hi>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and intending to paſs <hi>Severn</hi> to join with the <hi>Courtnies,</hi> he was prevented by the River, it being then without the Bancks, ſo not being able to get to them, nor they to him; his <hi>Welſh</hi>-men hereupon forſook him: whereupon the Duke fled to the Houſe of one <hi>Humphry Baniſter,</hi> formerly his Servant, and there in diſguiſe thought to have ſtayed, till he could either have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed new Forces or gotten into <hi>Britain</hi> to the Earl of <hi>Richmond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as the other Nobles heard of the misfortune of the Duke, they all left their Armies, and moſt of them fled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea to <hi>Henry;</hi> and the reſt took San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:65606:138"/>
and a Proclamation being made, with promiſe of a thouſand pounds to thoſe that could take <hi>Buckingham;</hi> this <hi>Judas Baniſter</hi> (who had gotten his Eſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Duke) was taken with the Golden Bait, and preferring, with <hi>Judas,</hi> the money before his Maſter's Life, went and diſcovered him to the Sheriff of <hi>Shrewsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> who took the Duke diſguiſed, like a poor Country-man, digging in a Grove near <hi>Baniſter's</hi> Houſe, and carried him to <hi>Salisbury,</hi> where the King then was; at which place without Arraignment or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he was beheaded; and ſeveral Nobles of the Duke's Faction received the like Doom at <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere: But this greedy <hi>Baniſter</hi> miſſing the promiſed Reward of the King, was rewarded with the Judgments of God, for not long after his Children came to unfortunate Ends, and he himſelf had got his deſerts in a Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that he eſcaped by his Clergy.</p>
               <p>And now the King hearing of Earl <hi>Henry</hi>'s preparation for <hi>England,</hi> he thereupon called a Parliament, in which the Earl and all thoſe that had fled to him were Attainted, and their Goods Confiſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the King alſo to make himſelf more ſecure at home, made Peace with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and ſent great Store of Gold to the Duke
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:65606:139"/>
of <hi>Britain</hi> to betray <hi>Henry</hi> into his hands; but the Duke, at the Arrival of the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, being ſo ſick that he could not be ſpoke withal, his Treaſurer allured with the Gold thought (though unknown to his Maſter) to have done the Feat; but Earl <hi>Henry,</hi> having notice hereof by Biſhop <hi>Morton</hi> then in <hi>Flanders,</hi> he eſcaped into <hi>France,</hi> to whom repaired the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> out of the Caſtle of <hi>Hammes,</hi> with Captain <hi>Blunt</hi> his Keeper and Sir <hi>John Forteſcue</hi> Captain of <hi>Callis,</hi> being all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to take their Fortune with Earl <hi>Henry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the King ſeeing the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> would not be taken with his Bait, he begins to ſolicit the Queen for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of her Daughters to his Cuſtody (thinking thereby to prevent the Match of the Earl <hi>Henry</hi> with the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> the eldeſt Daughter) and after many ſugared and fair flattering Speeches to the Queen, ſhe at length reſigned them up to him, and Queen <hi>Ann</hi> his Wife, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely made away, as was ſuppoſed, he now begins to Court his Neeſe <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (his own Brothers Daughter) intending to marry her; and to leſſen his expences, he diſcharged his Navy, commanding the <hi>Welſh</hi> to keep the ſhoar, where he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:65606:139"/>
Earl <hi>Henry</hi> intended to land; yet notwithſtanding ſhortly after he landed at <hi>Milford-Haven</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> with 2000 <hi>Britains,</hi> and marching into <hi>England</hi> as far as <hi>Litchfield,</hi> ſeveral worthy men joyned Forces with him on his March, and the King then at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intelligence hereof, commanded all his Nobles to wait upon him with their Forces, and ſo took his March to <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and the next morning pitched his Tents in a plain, called <hi>Reddmoor,</hi> neare <hi>Boſworth,</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> where he was encountered by the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> where after much Courage and Manhood ſhown, he was ſlain with ſome of his Nobles, and about 4000 Soldiers, and after he was ſlain: he, was taken and hung over an horſe, all naked and beſmeared with blood and dirt, and ſo was carryed to <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and there lay two days without Burial, for a ſpectacle to the people: and was afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred with great ſolemnity in the <hi>Grey-Fryers</hi> in <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and at the diſſolution thereof, the ſtone-trough wherein his Corps were laid, was taken up, and is now a drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trough for Horſes at a Common Inn in <hi>Leiceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Fight was over, the Lord <hi>Stanly</hi> found the Crown among the ſpoiles
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65606:140"/>
of the field, and ſet it upon the Earl of <hi>Richmond's</hi> head in the field, at which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant began the Reign of this new King; and ſo an End was put to the bloody Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, between the <hi>Yorkiſts</hi> and <hi>Lancaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians:</hi> there were fought here in <hi>England</hi> eleven Set-Battels, five in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixt days, as St. <hi>Albans, Blackheath, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, Wakefield,</hi> and <hi>Towton:</hi> and five in <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourths time; as, <hi>Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Banbury, Loſe-Coat-Field, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net field:</hi> and <hi>Tewxsbury,</hi> and laſtly <hi>Boſworth</hi> field, which put a period to the to the Reign of the <hi>Plantaginets,</hi> and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away for the <hi>Tewdors</hi> to ſucceed them: in theſe Civil Wars between the Houſes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York</hi> were ſlain above one Hundred and Sixteen Thouſand Men.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Richard</hi> the Third was King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he was a younger Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Fourth,</hi> and Son to <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who was Son to <hi>Edmund</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> who was Fifth Son to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third: his Reign began on <hi>Friday</hi> the 22 day of <hi>June, Anno</hi> 1483.

                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who in <hi>September</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was brought to Bed of Prince <hi>Arthur;</hi> and not long before the King's Marriage was <hi>Wheat</hi> ſold for three ſhillings <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, and <hi>Bay-Salt</hi> the ſame price: and the Croſs in <hi>Cheapſide</hi> was new builded.</p>
               <p>And now the King taking his Progreſs to <hi>York,</hi> to gain the Love of his <hi>Northern</hi> Subjects, the Lord <hi>Lovel</hi> with ſome others that had taken Sanctuary after <hi>Boſworth</hi> Field, raiſed forces, thinking to ſurprize the King, but he with 3000 men, under the Conduct of the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> ſent either to pardon or Fight them: and, the Duke proffering pardon, the Lord <hi>Lovel</hi> fled by night, and the multitude yeilded without ſtroak: and ſhortly after Sir <hi>Humphry Stafford</hi> another Rebel ſuffered at <hi>Tyburn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not long after a new Tumult be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan upon the Report of one <hi>Richard Symon</hi> a Prieſt, who broached abroad, that one <hi>Lambert Symnell</hi> Scholar of his, was heir to <hi>Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> (who was caſt into Priſon a little before by <hi>Henry</hi>) and ſo ſailing with him into <hi>Ireland,</hi> he there prevailed ſo much among the Peers, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecialy with <hi>Thomas Fitz-Girald</hi> Lord <hi>Chancelor</hi>) that at <hi>Dublin</hi> he was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

               <p>And ſhortly after this Battel the King ſent <hi>Richard Fox</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exceter,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Edgecomb</hi> Embaſſadors to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> where they, to the King's great Satisfaction, concluded a ſeven years Truce.</p>
               <p>About this time the Duke of <hi>Britain</hi> ſent to the King for his Aſſiſtance againſt <hi>France,</hi> but he unwilling to diſoblige ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, having been formerly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to both) ſought a reconciliation, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

               <p>And now began ſome ſtirs in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> where the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was ſlain by the Commons, at a place called <hi>Cock-Leg</hi> near <hi>Thirske,</hi> at the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one <hi>John Chambers,</hi> for demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subſidy granted by Parliament to the King: and the Plebeans afterwards made head under the Command of Sir <hi>John Egrimont,</hi> but the King ſending an Army againſt them, under the Command of <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry,</hi> they were quickly diſſipated, and the Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadears ſhortly after received death, the due Reward for ſuch Rebels: but Sr. <hi>John Egrimont</hi> eſcaped to <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of <hi>Britain,</hi> the common Encorager and Receiver of all King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Enemies.</p>

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65606:142"/>
and fought the Army at <hi>Bannocks-Burn,</hi> where, in a Mill in the ſame field, he was murthered.</p>
               <p>After this, King <hi>Henry</hi> began to prepare for War againſt <hi>France,</hi> at the Requeſt of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperor, whom they had baſely abuſed, in not only divorſing his Daughter <hi>Margaret</hi> from the <hi>French</hi> King, but alſo in making <hi>Ann,</hi> the Heir of the Dukedom of <hi>Britain,</hi> his Wife, who had been betrothed to the ſaid Emperor by his Embaſſadors; and the King taking his Voyage for <hi>France,</hi> landed at <hi>Callis,</hi> and marched on as far as <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperour unprepared, upon whoſe Accounts he had undertaken that War; he thereupon made Peace with <hi>France,</hi> and had the ſum of 186250 <hi>li.</hi> granted yearly, which was duly pay d du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his time and his Son's, until the debt vvas run out.</p>
               <p>After this Voyage, <hi>Margaret</hi> the Dutcheſs of <hi>Burgumdy,</hi> the King's grand Enemy, obtruded upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one <hi>Peterkin</hi> or <hi>Parkin Walbeck,</hi> by the name of <hi>Richard Plant aginet,</hi> Second Son of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Fourth, and many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity out of Innovation rather than Love (knowing it to be a Deceit of the Dutcheſs,) ſided with him, and the Lord <hi>Stanly</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

the reſt did ſupply him with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, for which Cauſe ſhortly after he loſt his Head, although formerly he had been a main Inſtrument in advancing the King to the Crown.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Wheat</hi> was ſold for ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, and Bay-Salt at three pence half peny, <hi>Nantwich</hi> ſalt ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Buſhel, white Herring ſix ſhilling <hi>per</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, red Herring three ſhilling <hi>per</hi> Cade, Sprats ſix pence <hi>per</hi> Cade, and <hi>Gaſcoign</hi> wine ſix pound <hi>per</hi> Tun.</p>
               <p>And now this Pſendo-<hi>Richard</hi> was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the King to be but <hi>Perkin War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beck,</hi> by one Sir <hi>Robert Clifford</hi> a great actor for <hi>Perkin</hi> beyound Sea; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards won to the King with Gold: for <hi>Perkin's</hi> ſake all the <hi>Flemmings</hi> were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Realm, and ſeveral of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices here, diſcovered by the ſaid Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Clifford,</hi> were put to death: And now <hi>Perkin</hi> coming on Shoar in <hi>Kent,</hi> expecting a great Relief, receiving in lieu therof great diſtreſs, for being encountred by the Mayor of <hi>Sandwich</hi> and the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> men, five of his Cheif Captains, and 164 of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were taken, and ſhortly after execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whereupon he fled back into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and from thence fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting, little help from ſo poor a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

at laſt he betook himſelf into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the King of <hi>Scots</hi> being taken with Courtly cariage believed his Reports, and Married him to <hi>Catharine Gourden</hi> the Earl of <hi>Huntly's</hi> Daughter, and then the King in Perſon, with a great number of <hi>Scots</hi> came with him againſt the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>England,</hi> doing great harm, and Proclaiming much favor and immunity to ſuch as would joyn with <hi>Perkin,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Upon this Account a Subſidy of 120 thouſand pound was granted to the King for maintenance of the War againſt <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Dawbnye</hi> ſent General, but on his March was called back to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome <hi>Corniſh</hi> Rebells, who withſtood the Collectors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Subſidy, under the Command of one <hi>Thomas Flemmock</hi> a Lawyer, and <hi>Michael Joſeph</hi> a Black-Smith; theſe marching for <hi>Kent,</hi> expecting more Aid, at <hi>Well</hi> the Lord <hi>Awdly</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, who, together with the other two Leaders, were taken at <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and their Forces Routed, three

hundred being ſlain and 1500 taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and afterwards the Lord <hi>Awdly</hi> was beheaded, at the other two hanged and quartered at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for their Rebellion.</p>
               <p>During theſe Stirs the King ſent the Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> to defend the parts in the <hi>North</hi> aganſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> who were then doing great Damage in the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but before he got thither the <hi>Scots</hi> withdrew; yet notwithſtanding he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after ſome Booty ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he returned again for a time.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Hialus</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor coming into <hi>Scotland</hi> he concluded a Peace between the two Kings.</p>
               <p>And about this time <hi>Anno</hi> 1497, fell Hail-Stones at St. <hi>Needs</hi> in <hi>Bedfordſhire</hi> of eighteen Inches about; now (upon the Concluſion of the Peace aforeſaid) <hi>Perkin's</hi> main Hope being gone, his laſt Refuge were the <hi>Corniſh</hi> men, of whom he had a great Army, but the King marching againſt him, and he not daring to truſt to his <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> followers, he thereupon fled by night and took <hi>Aſylum</hi> at <hi>Bewdly,</hi> which when his Followers perceived, they all yielded themſelves to the King's Mercy.</p>
               <p>And not long after <hi>Perkin</hi> their Leader did the like, and was carried to <hi>London,</hi> and conveved through the Streets on

               <p>About this time one <hi>Ralph Wilford,</hi> a Shoo-makers Son of <hi>London</hi> was hanged for aſſuming unto himſelf the name of <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who was then cloſe Priſoner in the Tower; and not long after <hi>Perkin</hi> was hanged at <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and <hi>Edward Plantaginet</hi> the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> beheaded for ſeeking to make their eſcape out of the Tower: this Earl was Son to <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, and was the laſt Heir of the <hi>Plantaginets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after this there happened ſuch a devouring Plague, that the King and Queen left <hi>London</hi> and fled to <hi>Callis</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> and after the Plague abated they returned again; about which time the Lady <hi>Catherine</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> arrived in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and was preſently after married to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> who injoyed her Bed not long, for about five months after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in <hi>Wales</hi> he was cut off by Death; an

               <p>And now the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> being fled, and intending a Rebellion, certain of his Adherents being diſcovered, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon taken, and ſuffered Death; as <hi>Courtney</hi> Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> the King's Brother in Law, <hi>William de la Pool</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Earl of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> Sir <hi>James Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel</hi> (King <hi>Richard</hi>'s Wicked Inſtrument in the Murther of <hi>Edward</hi> the V. and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and Sir <hi>John Windham</hi> and others; all theſe with the Earl and the reſt of his Faction, were by Authority of the Pope's Bull, Proclaimed at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs to be accurſed.</p>

               <p>Now the King having diſſipated all his Enemies, he began to extort Money from his Subjects, two Lawyers <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly</hi> being the cheif Inſtrument herein, by calling People in queſtion for the breach of old moth-eaten Penal Statutes; but the King's Death ſhortly after enſuing.

               <p>During this King's Reign, there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſome nine Perſons, Men and Women that ſuffered the Flames, for the Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a good Faith; beſides ſeveral others that did Pennance, with a Faggot on their Backs, and ſome were burnt in the Cheek with a hot Iron.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Now during the Siege at <hi>Terwin</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> under the Command of their King <hi>James</hi> the Fourth (<hi>Henry's</hi> Brother in Law) entered the Borders of <hi>England,</hi> pretending Truce broken (by the killing of <hi>Andrew Barton</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Pirate) againſt whom the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Sury</hi> Lord <hi>Lieutenant</hi> of the <hi>North</hi> went with an Army, to whom joyned his Son, the Lord Admiral, and theſe at <hi>Flodden</hi> Field fought the <hi>Scots,</hi> and gave them a great Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, killing the King, three Biſhops, two Abbots, twelve Earls, and ſeventeen Lords and Knights, beſides a great number of Gentlemen, and about 8000 Soldiers, and almoſt as many taken priſoners.</p>

               <p>And now Strangers growing inſolent in <hi>London,</hi> a great Tumult thereupon, under the Conduct of one <hi>John Lincoln</hi> did riſe on <hi>May Eve,</hi> for which Uproar he was hanged, and 400 Boyes and 11 Women were led through the City to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with halters about their Necks in their Shirts, but were pardoned by the King.

               <p>And now the King ſent an Army un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke <hi>Suffolk</hi> into <hi>France:</hi> who after ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral places won, and Winter approaching, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned honourably for <hi>England,</hi> but the Duke of <hi>Albany</hi> and the Lord Lieutenant of the <hi>North</hi> being ſtill at variance, at the Mediation of <hi>Margaret</hi> Queen of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> King <hi>Henrys</hi> Siſter, together with <hi>Wolſeys</hi> working with the King, at length Peace was concluded for a time both with <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> after this ſeveral Commotions roſe amongſt the Commons about the payment of the Subſide, which when the King heard, he pardoned the <hi>Offenders,</hi> and remitted the payment of the Subſidy: and now <hi>Wolſey</hi> began to alienate the King's heart from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and cauſed him to with-hold Pay from the Duke of <hi>Burbon,</hi> which was the cauſe of the <hi>French</hi> King's Captivity, of <hi>Burbon's</hi> March to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he entered the City in one day, and cauſed Pope

               <p>And during theſe Broyles at <hi>Rome,</hi> there aroſe great Troubles in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but they were quickly laid again by <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> Lord Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of that Kingdom, who being recalled into <hi>England</hi> upon ſome other Service, the Earl of <hi>Oſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The year 1527 fell ſuch abundance of Rain in <hi>November, December</hi> and <hi>January</hi> that the Corn fields, Paſtures, and Cattel were thereby deſtroyed: then was it dry till the 12 of <hi>April,</hi> and then Rain again every day and night till the 3 of <hi>June</hi> following, which cauſed ſuch a Famine in <hi>London</hi> and all <hi>England</hi> over, that many dyed for want of Succour.</p>
               <p>And now the King begins to charge the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65606:149"/>
Emperour with a promiſe of Marriage to Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (afterwards our Queen <hi>Mary</hi>) but her Legitimation was by him much queſtioned, as being begotten on his Brother <hi>Arthur's</hi> Wife: hereupon the King grew into diſlike of his Marriage, and diſclaimed his Contract, it being the Opinion of ſome ſix Forein Univerſities to be an unlawful Marriage; and for this cauſe Cardinal <hi>Campius</hi> came into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with whom was joined Cardinal <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> in Commiſſion, with power to erect a Court to hear the King's Cauſe pleaded, which accordingly was done; and when Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Divorcement ſhould have been (according to the King's expectation) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, <hi>Campius</hi> then cauſed Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made, and adjourned the Court, and referred the Sentence to the Pope.</p>
               <p>The King highly diſpleaſed hereat ſent Dr. <hi>Cranmer</hi> and ſome others to the Pope to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute the unlawfulneſs of the Marriage, who gave <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> (the grand <hi>Rabbi</hi> in thoſe days) ſuch Satisfaction in this point, ſo that none of the Pope's Diſputants durſt encounter the Doctor about it, whereupon, a Parliament being called by the King, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were forbidden to appeal, or make payment to <hi>Rome:</hi> and further, the King's Marriage with the Lady <hi>Catherine</hi> of Spain,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65606:149"/>
by the ſaid Parliament was Diſſolved.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe proceedings in <hi>England,</hi> the Pope cauſed his Curſe to be ſet up at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk</hi> in <hi>Flanders</hi> againſt the King, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Marriage Lawful, but the King regarded it not; for hereby the Pope loſt his Supremancy in <hi>England,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> their Heads for ſtanding for it.</p>
               <p>And now the King married the Lady <hi>Ann Bullin</hi> Daughter to Viſcount <hi>Rochford,</hi> which Lady was accounted a <hi>Lutheran;</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Wolſey</hi> for his diſlike of this Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Adjourning of the Court, as is before ſhewed; fell into the Kings Diſpleaſure; and ſeveral Articles being exhibited againſt him in Parliament, as that he uſed to write in his Letters, <hi>I and my King,</hi> and had cauſed the Cardinals Cap to be ſtamped on the Kings Coyn, and ſeveral other grand Offences. hereupon he loſt all his Dignities; and his Houſe and Furniture were ſeized, and the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was ſent to bring him up to anſwer his Charge, who took him at <hi>Cawood</hi> Caſtle, about ſeven miles from <hi>York;</hi> and as he was on his Journy to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> at <hi>Leiceſter</hi> Abby, he ended his dayes, by taking an over much quantity of an <hi>Italian</hi> Confection, for breaking Wind from his Stomach, as Report went: He is ſaid

to have ſuppreſſed 40 Monaſterys for the raiſing his two Colledges in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and to have laid by 12 Barrels full of Gold and Silver to ſerve the Pope in his Wars.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Elizabeth Barton,</hi> called the holy Maid of <hi>Kent,</hi> was reported by thoſe who feared the Downfall of <hi>Babel,</hi> to have Revelations from <hi>Heaven;</hi> among which one was, That if the King proceeded in his Second Marriage, he ſhould not Reign a Moneth to an end, but the <hi>Mouth</hi> of this Oracle was quickly ſtopt, for herſelf with ſeven of her Diſciples were all execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Tyburn</hi> for Treaſon.</p>
               <p>And now the Pope ſeeing his Revenue here in <hi>England</hi> likely to go to <hi>wrack<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> began to write and ſtir up <hi>James</hi> the Fifth King of <hi>Scots</hi> againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> his Uncle, promiſing the Crown of <hi>England</hi> to thoſe that could win it.</p>
               <p>About this time Queen <hi>Ann</hi> was deliver'd of the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> afterwards Queen of <hi>England,</hi> and the next year after of a Dead Child: and not long after ſhe was ſent to the Tower, and falſely accuſed of Adultery and Inceſt, for which ſhe with her Brother the Lord <hi>Rochford,</hi> and <hi>Norris, Weſton,</hi> and <hi>Brierton,</hi> gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, together with one <hi>Marks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

all loſt their Heads: and the next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Queen <hi>Ann's</hi> Death, the King married the Lady <hi>Jane Seymer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now began the Lord <hi>Cromwells</hi> riſing, who by birth was a <hi>Black Smyth's</hi> Son, and had been Cardinal <hi>Wolſey's</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciter, he was firſt made Maſter of the King's Jewel-houſe, Baron of <hi>Oakham</hi> in <hi>Rutlandſhire,</hi> then Knight of the <hi>Garter,</hi> after that Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and then Lord high Chamberlain, and laſtly the King's Vicar general: he was the Sole cauſe of the demoliſhing of Monaſteryes, and the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down of <hi>Images, Idols</hi> and <hi>Shrines,</hi> in the Churches of <hi>England:</hi> but this Pillar of the Church was undermined by <hi>Stephen Gardener</hi> (that Murtherer of Proteſtants in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> dayes) and ſo by his means being brought into Diſlike with the King, at length he was beheaded.</p>
               <p>Now ſeveral Commotions aroſe in <hi>York<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> occaſioned by the demoliſhing of Abbys; the Commons being incited thereto by the Monks who had loſt their <hi>Roast-meat</hi> and took ill with <hi>Courſer Fair:</hi> but after ſeveral propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by the Commons to the King, and Anſwers thereunto, having Pardon granted, they threw down their Arms, but ſeveral of the Monks riſing again with

ſeveral perſons of Quality; as the Lord <hi>Darcy,</hi> Lord <hi>Huſſye,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Conſtable,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Percy,</hi> Sir <hi>Francis Biggot,</hi> Sir <hi>Stephen Hambleton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Bulmer</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Fountains,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaulx,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Rivax,</hi> and Prior of <hi>Burlington,</hi> were afterwards taken and ſuffered Death: and now the King having been two years a Widower, ſince the death of Queen <hi>Jane</hi> (who dyed in Child-Bed of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixt, afterwards King) he was married to the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> but about half a year after, through <hi>Gardiner's</hi> falſe Sugueſtions, was by Parliament divorſed from her; and not long after he Married <hi>Catherine Howard</hi> Daughter to <hi>Edward</hi> Brother to <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk:</hi> but about 6 Moneths after her Marriage, ſhe was condemned of Adultery and loſt her Head at Tower Hill, and with her the Lady <hi>Jane Rochford</hi> and ſeveral others that year, as <hi>Margaret</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres, Francis Dereham</hi> and <hi>Thomas Culpeper;</hi> and now the King married the Lady <hi>Katherin Parr</hi> Wife to the Lord <hi>Lattimer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And about this time it was enacted by Parliament to be high Treaſon, either to deny the Oath of the King's Supremacy, or to acknowledg the Pope, and though
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65606:151"/>
by this the Diſcipline of the Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, yet little of Doctrine was changed, for it was made hereſie and death to deny any of the Six Articles following: as,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That after the ſpeaking of the words of Conſecration by the Prieſt, the Real and Natural Body and Blood of Chriſt, as he was Conceived and Crucified, was in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and no other ſubſtance.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Communion in both kinds is not neceſſary to Salvation.</item>
                  <item>3. That Prieſts may not marry.</item>
                  <item>4. That Vows of Chaſtity ought to be obſerved, by the Laws of God.</item>
                  <item>5. That private Maſſes ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, and</item>
                  <item>6. That <hi>Auricular</hi> Confeſſion is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and expedient to be retained in the Church of God.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Upon the denial of theſe ſix Articles ſeveral People ſuffered the Flames.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1541. The King took upon him the Title of King of <hi>Ireland:</hi> and the ſame year ſent an Army againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> under the Command of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> who when he came to Fight the <hi>Scots</hi> they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly loſt the day, and ſuffered themſelves to be taken Priſoners, out of diſdain to their Leader <hi>Oliver</hi> St. <hi>Clere;</hi> for grief whereof their King <hi>James</hi> the fifth dyed, there was
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:65606:152"/>
at this time 21 men of Account taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and committed to the Tower of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> but ſhortly after theſe Priſoners were releaſed again, and a Peace for 10 years concluded, upon the promiſe of a Marriage with the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> King <hi>James</hi> his only Child, and Prince <hi>Edward, Henry's</hi> Son and Heir, afterwards King, by the name of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the ſixt: but the Pope and the <hi>French</hi> diſwading the <hi>Scots</hi> from this Marriage, King <hi>Henry</hi> thereupon made War againſt both Nations, and took <hi>Bulloyn</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the Redemption whereof and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Peace, the <hi>French</hi> were to pay him in Eight years ſpace 800000 Crownes: and during theſe proceedings in <hi>France,</hi> the King's Army did much harm to the <hi>Scots</hi> by burning <hi>Edenbrough,</hi> and waſting the Country for 7 Miles round about; but all theſe ſtirs were ended by King <hi>Henry's</hi> Death which not long after enſued.</p>
               <p>The year 1545. The 27 of <hi>April,</hi> one <hi>William Foxly</hi> Pot-maker for the Mint, fell a ſleep in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and ſlept 14 days and 15 nights, and could not by any means be awakned, and when he did awake, ſeemed in all things as if he had ſlept but one Night.</p>
               <p>And this ſame year began the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> which was continued till <hi>Anno
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:65606:152"/>
1563. Paul</hi> the III. <hi>Julius</hi> the III. and <hi>Pio</hi> the IV. being Popes: this was the 18 Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council.</p>
               <p>The King, about the 13 of his Reign, writ a Book againſt <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> and ſent it to the Pope, for which he had the Tittle given of <hi>Defender of the Faith</hi> (which his Succeſſors retain to this day.) But not long after falling to variance with the Pope (as is ſhewed before) he writ another Book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pope: during this Kings Reign ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral perſons, to the number of 81, ſuffered the Flames for the Profeſſion of their Faith: and before <hi>Luthers</hi> time ſeveral perſons did the like: for in <hi>Henry</hi> the IV time ſuffered 3: in <hi>Henry</hi> V time about 40 ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: beſides ſeveral others grivouſly perſecuted. 8 in <hi>Henry</hi> VI time, and above 100 whipped and perſecuted: one in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth's time: and about ſome 9 in <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. time.</p>
               <p>Her after followeth a true and perfect Cattalogue of the number of all the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious houſes, as Monaſterys, Prioryes Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orys Nunnerys, Colledges and Hoſpitals in every County of <hi>England,</hi> which were demoliſhed in this Kings Reign, with their valluation, as they were preſented to the King by the Commiſſioners at the time of their Suppreſſion.</p>

of <hi>England</hi> during his Nephews Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, returning from <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was then called, wherein it was Enacted that the Statute of the 6 Articles in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eights time, and thoſe of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth for ſuppreſſion of the Scriptures in <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhould be all repealed; and Images all thrown out of the Churches throughout the Realm, and the Church Service to be read in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Sacrament exhibited in both kinds; and the other old Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were aboliſhed; and all thoſe that made oppoſition were either impriſoned, or deprived of their places.

               <p>At this time alſo the Mayor of <hi>Bodmyn</hi> was Hanged, and a Millers Man who took upon him his Maſter's name and cauſe,

               <p>No ſooner were theſe Troubles quelled, but one <hi>Robert Ket</hi> moved about 20000 Commons in <hi>Norfolk</hi> to a Rebellion, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> in which place the Lord <hi>Dudly</hi> ſhortly after cauſed 60 of them to be executed, and afterwards over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw their Army, and took <hi>Ket</hi> their Leader, who was hanged up in Chains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Top of the Caſtle of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and 9 of his Companions hanged in the Oak of Reformation, a Tree in which <hi>Ket</hi> uſed to ſit as Judge to determine of their intended Reformation and Proceedings: the great occaſion of theſe Commotions in ſeveral Counties in <hi>England</hi> was againſt Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and taking up of waſt Grounds, which was then coming into Faſhion, for they diſparked a great many Parks and other incloſed Grounds, whereupon ſeveral of them were ſlain in the Quarrel, the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans</hi> alſo at <hi>Seymer</hi> near <hi>Scarborough</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> roſe alſo under the Conduct one <hi>William Ombler</hi> a Yeoman there, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Dale</hi> a Pariſh Clerk, and one <hi>Stephen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> the Poſt, but the King ſending down

               <p>A little before Arrival of King <hi>Philip,</hi> two Suns were ſeen at one time, and a Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow reverſed the Bow turning downwards, before the Marriage certain Honourable Conditions were propounded to King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> and agreed to by him.

               <p>About this time <hi>Francis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> dying, <hi>Charles</hi> his Brother ſucceeded him, and great Diſſentions ariſing, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> ſought a Reconciliation, but it could not be obtained: whereupon, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of Religion, ſhe ſent an Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> under the Command of Lord <hi>Ambroſe Dudly,</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who landed at <hi>Newhaven</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and after eleven moneths poſſeſſion thereof, were then conſtrained to render it to the <hi>French,</hi> through Famine and Plague which they brought into <hi>England, Anno</hi> 1563, whereof there dyed in 8 moneths ſpace 23660.</p>

               <p>And not long after this, the Queen was deprived of all Princely Authority, at the fained ſuit of one <hi>Morton</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Pope ſent his Bull into <hi>England</hi> to that purpoſe, which Bull being hung up at the Biſhop of <hi>London's</hi> gate, the bringer therof <hi>John Felton</hi> was for his paines hanged and quartered in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>

                  <hi>An.</hi> 1603. one <hi>John Lepton</hi> of <hi>Repwick</hi> Eſquire in the County of <hi>York,</hi> undertook to Ride 5 ſeveral times betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York</hi> in ſix days, to be taken in one week, between Monday morning and <hi>Saturday</hi> night: and began his Journy Monday Morning the 20 of <hi>May,</hi> and finiſhed his Journy on Friday after, to the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of all men.</p>
               <p>Two years after, to wit, <hi>Anno</hi> 1605. one <hi>William Calverly</hi> of <hi>Calverly</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>York</hi> Eſquire, murthered two of his own Children at home at his own houſe, then Stabbed his Wife into the Body, with full Intent to have killed her, and then went out with Intention to have killed his Child at nurſe, but was prevented: he was Preſſed to death at <hi>York</hi> for this murther, becauſe he ſtood Mute and would not plead. And now although the King had made Peace with the <hi>Popes</hi> Champion the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> yet his Holineſs Sons thought to have brought the Ruine of the King and all the Kingdom to Light.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1605. by a treacherous Plot of blowing up the King and whole Nobility, Root and Branch at one Blow when they were Aſſembled in Parliament; to which end they had laid in ſeveral Barrels of Gunpowder, Barrs of Iron, Faggots, and and other things for doing Execution under the Parliament houſe: but this Helliſh Deſign was hapily diſcovered by a Letter ſent to the Lord <hi>Mounteagle</hi> ſon to the Lord <hi>Morley,</hi> by ſome of the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, wherein <hi>they wiſhed him to ſtay his Appearance from the Houſe the firſt day of the ſitting:</hi> this Letter being Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated and ſhewn to ſeveral of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they could not ſathom the depth of the dark meaning thereof, but at length being ſhewn to the King, he preſently conjectured that the Plot was to blow up the Houſe with Gunpowder; and ſo, narrow Search being made, it was happyly found out, and the Conſpirators diſcovered: who were ſome of them ſhot to death (to wit, <hi>Percy</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi>) for diſdaining to be taken, others of them were ſlain by <hi>Gunpowder</hi> which they had drying by the Fire, and Sir <hi>Everard Digby,</hi> the two <hi>Wrights, John</hi> and <hi>Chriſtopher, Fawkes, Graunt, Winter, Boits,</hi> and <hi>Keyes,</hi> were
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:65606:170"/>
Hanged, Drawn and Quartered for being chief Actors in this Plot.</p>
               <p>After this ſtorm was over, the Faces of more troubles appeared through the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Rainolds,</hi> in <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amptonſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwick-ſhire,</hi> but this flame quickly vaniſhed into Smoak.</p>
               <p>About this time the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the King's Daughter was married to <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> Count Elector Palatine.

               <p>And now <hi>Charles</hi> the King's Second Son (afterwards King) ſucceeded his Brother in the Principallity of <hi>Wales:</hi> about this time Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was releaſed, intending to viſit the new found World, and many Gentlemen took their fortunes with him: but unhappily in his Voyage burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing St. <hi>Thomes,</hi> it ſhortly after coſt him his Life, for Intelligence being given to <hi>Condibert</hi> then Embaſſador in <hi>England,</hi> he never left preſſing the King for Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: hereupon Sir <hi>Walter</hi> as ſoon as he

               <p>And about this time the King being very Sick, he happily Recovered again, but his Loving and vertuous Queen <hi>Ann</hi> dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1618.</p>
               <p>After this the King made a Motion of Marriage for his Son <hi>Charles</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> with the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Daughter; thinking thereby to gain opportunity of helping his Son in Law, who having been lately choſen by ſome of the <hi>German</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> was afterwards upon ſome diſtaſt driven out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> by the Emperor, and afterwards out of all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and remained at this time in <hi>Holland,</hi> being a Refuge for all diſtreſſed people.</p>
               <p>To effect this marriage, the Prince with the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> went for <hi>Spain,</hi> where ſeeing the Marriage with himſelf and the Lady <hi>Maria</hi> the Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> procraſtinated and delaid, left the Court and Returned for <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 1623. The Plantations in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> were ſettled in this Kings time; he was a very learned King, as appears by his Works now in print: he was an honeſt

Father to his Childern, worthy of his wife; and good to his ſubjects, and a great deſirer of Peace, whoſe Motto was <hi>Beati Pacifici,</hi> and as he deſired Peace ſo he dyed in Peace.</p>
               <p>This <hi>James</hi> was King of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi> he was Son to <hi>Henry Stuart</hi> Lord <hi>Darly,</hi> who was Grand Child to Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> eldeſt Daughter to King <hi>Henry</hi> the VII of <hi>England,</hi> by her Second Husband: and his Mother was <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who was Grand Child alſo to Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> by her firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>James</hi> the fourth King of <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo that the ſaid Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> was great Grand-mother to King <hi>James</hi> both by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mothers ſide.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SHortly after his Coronation at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> he proceeded to a Marriage with <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>France,</hi> whom he had formerly ſeen in his journy through that Country into <hi>Spain:</hi> his firſt Complement to her, when he went to meet her at <hi>Dover</hi> was, <hi>That he deſired to be no longer Maſter of himſelf, then he was Servant to her:</hi> and indeed this Love he continued to the laſt hour of his Life: for on the day before his unfortunate end, he deſired his Daughter the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to aſſure her Mother, if ever She ſee her again, That his Thoughts had never Strayed from her, and that his Affections ſhould be the ſame to the Laſt.</p>
               <p>After the King's Marriage was over, his diſlike againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from that Court, was ſtill freſh in his memory: whereupon a Fleet was ſet to Sea, who ſpoiling all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:65606:172"/>
Veſſels they met withal, for that time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; and after this, the King called a Parliament, and deſired a Subſidy, but was denied, notwithſtanding his Treaſures were Exhauſted, and the War Juſt and Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>But although the Parliament denied the King a Supply, he made uſe of ſome other means for pocurement of Money, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Amity and Forces with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces,</hi> once again he ſet a mighty Navy to Sea, which did mightily annoy the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Coaſt, and ſpoiled their Ships: and among the reſt ſome of <hi>France</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Preys to them; which cauſed the Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants Goods: whereupon ſeveral <hi>French</hi> were comand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave <hi>England;</hi> but <hi>Monſieur Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſompiere,</hi> coming Embaſſador, prevailed ſo far that ſeveral <hi>French</hi> were again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called: but nevertheleſs all Commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kingdoms was prohibited on both ſides. And the <hi>French</hi> grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppreſſed the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> to whoſe Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance ſeveral men were ſent out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> but doing little good, they returned again, for which Cauſe ſome were Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned.</p>
               <p>And now ſeveral Complaints being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited upon this Account by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:65606:173"/>
the King diſſolved them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended new Supplies under the Duke's Command for <hi>Rochell;</hi> but he being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Embarque was Stabbed by one <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who got the Gallows for his Reward.</p>
               <p>And now the King called another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, deſiring a Grant of <hi>Tunnage,</hi> but was denied: whereupon they were Diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, upon which Account great Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions aroſe, the King Commanding the Merchants to pay their Cuſtoms, and the Parliament forbidding them: whereupon ſeveral Members were Impriſoned: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt Sir <hi>John Elliot</hi> was one, but the Merchants ready enough to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thoſe Commands, were moſt for their Advantage, did thereupon obey the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments Mandates, and ſlighted the King's: they remembring that about 100 years before, there was a Penalty impoſed upon the Merchants, for paying their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, the Parliament being then againſt it: and in Memory thereof there was a Chappel built called <hi>Alderman-Bury; Anno 1630, May</hi> the 29, the Queen was brought to Bed of Prince <hi>Charles,</hi> now King of <hi>England:</hi> and about 6 years after, Mr. <hi>Hambden</hi> refuſing to pay Ship-money, Sentence paſſed againſt him by 12 of the Judges, who abſolutely declared for the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:65606:173"/>
Legality of it, only Judg <hi>Hutton</hi> and Judg <hi>Crook</hi> diſſented; and new Stirs now ariſing about the <hi>Book of Common-Prayer</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> (which occaſioned the ſad War that afterwards enſued, the King marched thitherward with an Army, and the <hi>Scots</hi> meeting him, laid down their Arms: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Peace was concluded, but at the King's return he was again Pricked for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by ſome, who rather ſought their own Advantage than his: hereupon he went again for <hi>Scotland,</hi> but nothing was done: and now they had taken their <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> (as it was called) againſt the King, who called a Parliament to relieve his wants: but they treading in their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors Steps denied him a Supply.</p>
               <p>And now the <hi>Iriſh</hi> being afreſh in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the Long Parliament (for ſo it was called) by Reaſon of its long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, for the King had Signed a Bill for them to Sit as long as they pleaſed) ſought means to ſuppreſs them: and all Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were forbidden in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but only ſuch as were uſen in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time: the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> were Impeached of High-Treaſon, and ſent to the Tower; and moſt of the Judges who had declared for Ship-mony
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:65606:174"/>
were Voted Delinquents; Judg <hi>Berkly</hi> was Arreſted by the Uſher of the Black Rod for High-Treaſon, as he ſate on the King's Bench. Seven <hi>Romiſh</hi> Preiſts were alſo Impriſoned, whoſe Pardon was granted by the Parliament, at the Requeſt of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſador, and the King to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate himſelf releaſed them; at which the Parliament took Snuff, becauſe they were not firſt made acquainted before their Releaſement: and to thwart the King in his Proceedings, they changed their former Decree, and cauſed two of the Prieſts to be put to Death, which Act of theirs took mainly with the People: but this (as good Reaſon) diſpleaſed the King, who complained of the Inſolencies of the Lower houſe to his Peers, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to diſplace ſome Officers of State, putting in another Lieutenant of the Tower, whereupon the Lower houſe did Article a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the new Lieutenant to the Peers, who refuſed to meddle in the Buſineſs, it being the King's Prerogative to put in whom he pleaſed: but not long after a multitude of Apprentices and other People came Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring to the Hall-Door, crying to have the new Lieutenant either remov'd, or elſe they would turn All upſide down. This giddy headed Rabble of <hi>Plebeans</hi> demanded alſo
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65606:174"/>
that Biſhops ſhould be Excluded the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament-houſe; and, to ſatisfy their blind folly, they ran into <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abby, and ſpoiled the Veſtments, Organs and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchers, and all elſe that was comely or decent: and from thence they ran confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and there Thundered out the ſame Languages; but leaſt they ſhould proceed to ſome further Inſolencies, the King the next day fortified himſelf with a ſtrong Guard.</p>
               <p>And now things beginning to work for the Parliament, they thought it good pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to make Hay whileſt the Sun ſhone, and to ſtrike whileſt the Iron was hot; and hereupon they (under the pretence of ſome Fear) aſſumed to themſelves a Guard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, for their Defence, and conſtituted the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Captain thereof: and further they (without the King's Conſent or Knowledge) appointed an Extraordinary Aſſembly in the City of <hi>London:</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ingratiate themſelves with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty-mongers, they caſt 12 Biſhops into Priſon, which Buſineſs much troubled the King: and the year before, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641, the Lord <hi>Strafford</hi> was Beheaded, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years after the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who died as Sacrifices for the
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65606:175"/>
Popular Fury, and Martyrs for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
               <p>Now the King grieved at theſe Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, proceeded to accuſe one Member of the Houſe of Peers, and five of the Houſe of Commons of High-Treaſon: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Members, they were denied to be delivered to him; whereupon he with 500 Armed men went to the Hall, he alone entring the Parliament Houſe, and not ſeeing any of the Accuſed Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers there, he then declared his Good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to the Parliament, and ſo return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the next day went again, but found them not: the Parliament hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put the City in Arms; and Adjourned their Sitting for five days, forbidding the Citizens to help the King to find out any of the ſaid Members; whoſe Commands they ſo far obeyed as that in Deſpight of the King they carried the ſaid Members, and placed them in the Houſe again, in their ſeveral places; and the Parliament ſtill proceeding to leſſen the King's Power, ſent Letters to the adjacent Counties, commanding them to draw up in Arms, upon which Account there was ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occaſion above twenty Thouſand men: the King ſeeing theſe Proceedings haſted to <hi>Hampton-Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:65606:175"/>And now the Parliament daily increaſed in their Power, and went and ſate in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to endear themſelves the more to the Citizens: and forthwith ſent their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates to the reſpective Governors of the Sea-port Towns, Prohibiting them to obey any of the King's Orders, unleſs they were confirmed by them: hereby they weakned the King's Authority, more than all their former Proceedings had done; which the King might eaſily have prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in time, if he had put Soldiers into the ſaid Towns to have kept them for himſelf.</p>
               <p>And not long after this, they took into their hands moſt Sea-Port Towns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, among which <hi>Hull</hi> was one: which denied to the King, and delivered to them. And now the King ſeeing the harſh proceedings of the Parliament, he writ to them from <hi>Windſor,</hi> proteſting his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: whereupon they ſent Meſſengers to him to deſire his return to <hi>London,</hi> but he refuſed: upon which occaſion the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er-Houſe drew up an Humble <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance</hi> (as they called it) whoſe Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions were ſo unreaſonable, that the Houſe of Peers would not conſent to them, till they ſaw the Commons uniting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt them: and then Meſſengers were ſent to the King with the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance,</hi>

who with ſome Reſervation yielded to part of it, and denied the other part: yet this would not ſatisfie them, but they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded further to Petition the King, That the accuſed Members might be free and clear from all Guilt, which was granted them: but now thoſe who favoured the King's Cauſe, fearing the event of theſe proceedings, part of them left <hi>England,</hi> and part repaired home, leaving the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; ſo that there were not above 25 in the Upper-Houſe, and ſcarce 80 in the Lower-Houſe; and ſhortly after hardly 16 in the upper Houſe, and the Queen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time left <hi>England,</hi> accompanying her Daughter to her Husband the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> to whom ſhe was Eſpouſed: and the King cauſed all Prieſts to be baniſhed out of the Realm, and ſevere Statutes to be publiſhed againſt the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>And now all things growing worſe and worſe, the Parliament began to take the boldneſs upon them to accuſe the King of harkning to a Change in Religion: and that he had given Cauſe to the Uproars in <hi>Ireland:</hi> but eſpecially thoſe that were moſt powerful with him, ſecretly beſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Queen: the King to remove theſe Aſpertions, Publiſhed his <hi>Declarations</hi> to the People of his Innocency; but they ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  </hi> Reſolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppoſe Force againſt Force.</p>
               <p>And now the King, after ſeveral Paſſages between him and the Parliament, called all the Knights of the <hi>Garter,</hi> and all others that held of the Crown, to Repair to <hi>York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament on the contrary, made it death for any to go, yet notwithſtanding ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers went over to the King upon this Account.</p>
               <p>And now people fearing the worſt, the Men of <hi>Kent</hi> Petitioned the Parliament on the behalf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the King: That nothing might be done without the King's Conſent; that the Liturgy might not be altered; That the Biſhops might be reſtored, (whom they had Excluded the Lords Houſe) That they would not ſuffer the Fundamental Laws of the Land to be Antiquated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings permiſſion; Nor Arms to be raiſed without his Command; That ſome good means might be found out to make a Reconcilement, &amp;<hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Petition was ill taken, and the brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, therof together with the Earl of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol</hi> the Receivers of it, were both Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for their Pains: and <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> men afterwards preferring a Petition to the Parliament, they Commanded it to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65606:177"/>
be burnt by the Common Hang-man.</p>
               <p>And now, after Thwartings and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents between the King and Parliament, he at laſt Commanded all the <hi>York-ſhire</hi> men to meet him at a certain place called <hi>Howard Moor,</hi> near <hi>York<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> who according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared, being about Threeſcore Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men: and the King with the Prince, and ſome Lords, about ſix hundred horſe met them there, and with about twenty thouſand men went back to <hi>York:</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them all to repaire to their Houſes: in the mean time the Parliment borrow'd a great Sum of money of the <hi>Londoners,</hi> on the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> (as they called it;) and Raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Army of ten thouſand Foot, and two thouſand Horſe, they ſent them towards <hi>York;</hi> in the Interim the King aſſailed <hi>Hull,</hi> but was withſtood by Sir <hi>John Hotham:</hi> and having this bad Succeſs at firſt, he thereupon ſent to the Parliament to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace, and promiſed forthwith to repair to them, if they would leave <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and make choice of ſome other place to Sit in: but they Refuſed it; whereupon the King proclaimed all men guilty of Treaſon, that ſhould Aſſiſt the Houſes either with Money or other Supplyes, and alſo threatned to deprive the <hi>Londoners</hi> of their Priviledges, if they offended herein;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65606:177"/>
and the King having fortified <hi>Newark</hi> and <hi>Barwick,</hi> ſought again to obtain <hi>Hull,</hi> but in vain: and now the Parliament Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed open War, making the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> General: and the King ſet up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham:</hi> and now it being come to open War, the Victory was doubtful, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one Side, ſometimes the other get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the better, with no ſmall loſs of blood, and the Life of many a gallant man: and the Prince, when he ſaw his Fathers Affairs in a deſperate Condition, took Shipping for the <hi>Scillyes,</hi> from whence he was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Parliament to return to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> but he thought it not ſafe for his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> to do ſo, and ſo ſailed to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to his Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> where he remained till the Sad News of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Murther was brought to him.</p>

excellent Book called <hi>Icon Baſilicon,</hi> and afterwards coming to a Treaty of Peace, the King ſo far condeſcended, as that it was then Voted <hi>Satisfactory;</hi> after which the Army and thoſe of the Parliament, who had all this time aimed at ſelf Intereſts, began to diſplay themſelves in their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; turning out all ſuch Members of the Houſe of Parliament as they ſuſpected: and conveyed the King to <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle, and afterwards to <hi>Windſor;</hi> during which proceedings ſeveral Bickerings and Ingagements had happened between the <hi>Royalliſts</hi> and <hi>Parliamentarians;</hi> the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al party every where to going wrack, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at <hi>Maidſtone, Pontefract, Bow, Stratford, Kingſton</hi> and <hi>Preſton,</hi> where the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army received a great Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, looſing a world of men.

               <p>And now the Army, and thoſe Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers then left in the Houſe (after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were Secluded) deviſed and ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a new unheard of Tribunal, called a <hi>High-Court of Juſtice,</hi> to take Cognizance of the King's Cauſe: one <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant

               <p>KING <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt being Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly Murthered, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now began to lop of ſeveral Nobles heads, and other of the late King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, as Duke <hi>Hamelton,</hi> Lord <hi>Capell,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Holland;</hi> and now they thought to have intailed their Sitting from Generation to Generation, never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to rife again by a Diſſolution: and to this intent they put out an Act, whereby they took all (as they thought, either Right or Hope of Succeſſion from <hi>Charles</hi> the Second: and likewiſe diſinabled all the reſt of his Brothers and Siſters from Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting any thing in <hi>England:</hi> and they cauſed the King's Arms to be pulled down every where; and in their places were ſet up the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Harp,</hi> which they called the <hi>States Arms;</hi> the King's Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture alſo in the old <hi>Exchange</hi> they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be defaced, and the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription ſet behind the head of it in Gold Letters.</p>

               </q>
               <p>They likewiſe cauſed the Titles of all Proceſs at Law to be altered, and in ſtead of <hi>Carolus Dei Gratia,</hi> &amp;c. they put in <hi>Cuſtodes Libertatis Angliae,</hi> &amp;c. and cauſed the Court of <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench</hi> to be called by the name of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper-Bench:</hi> They made alſo a new Stamp for Money, with the <hi>Croſs</hi> on one ſide thereof, and the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Harp</hi> on the other ſide, and the Circumſcription on the one ſide was <hi>The Common-wealth of</hi> England, and on the other ſide <hi>God with us.</hi> And there was alſo a new great Seal made.</p>
               <p>And now the Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi> having laid down his Commiſſion, the Parliament made <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> their General, who was ſo Fortunate in all his Enterprizes, that in a few years time he brought <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> into Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: truth is, if his Cauſe had been Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Juſt, he would have been as much Honoured by Poſterity for his Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, as he is hated by all good Subjects for his <hi>Diſloyalty</hi> and <hi>Inhumanity</hi> to his Sovereign Lord and Maſter the King.</p>
               <p>And now his Majeſty being in <hi>France,</hi> he hoped to get Aid there, but found none;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:65606:186"/>
yet his Friends here in <hi>England</hi> Proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him King, the Earl of <hi>Ormond</hi> and Lord <hi>Inchequin</hi> cauſed him alſo to be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the Parliament proceeded to make Sale of the King and Queen's Lands, not ſparing their Houſes; whoſe Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers gained no ſmall Summs by them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Money of the Leads, Glaſs, Iron, Timber and Stones of the ſame Houſes: the Biſhops with the Deans and Chapters Lands alſo received the ſame Doom, and moſt of the Caſtles in <hi>England</hi> were by the Parliament's Order demoliſhed and thrown down: and all Perſons were expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from places of Truſt either in Church or State, which would not Subſcribe to the preſent Government then Eſtabliſhed by them.</p>
               <p>And now his Majeſty was Proclaimed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and after great Debate had among them there, at length they agree on ſome Propoſitions to be ſent to the King, who was then at the Iſle of <hi>Jerſie,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Windram</hi> Laird of <hi>Libberton</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Meſſenger: The Heads of which Propoſitions were,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That his Majeſty ſhould ſign the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he ſhould paſs divers Acts of

Parliament, which were concluded on in their two laſt Seſſions of Parliament in <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That he ſhould be pleaſed to recall the late Commiſſions, given to <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That he ſhould put away all Papiſts from him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he would appoint ſome place about <hi>Holland</hi> to Treat with their Comiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners.</p>
               <p>And 6. That he would be graciouſly pleaſed to give a ſpeedy Anſwer to their Deſires.</p>
               <p>Theſe Propoſitions coming to the King, they were very ſtifly debated <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con,</hi> and after much Conſultation, at laſt Sir <hi>William Flemming</hi> was ſent Agent to the Committee of the Eſtates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> till ſuch as the Laird <hi>Libberton</hi> could be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched: who ſhortly after followed with a Letter and Inſtructions by word of Mouth to the Committee of Eſtates, and <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> was appointed for the place of a ſolemn Treaty; and after great debates by the Committee of Eſtates and <hi>Kirk</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> at long run it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the Earl of <hi>Caſtles,</hi> the Lord <hi>Lothian, Burly</hi> and <hi>Libberton,</hi> Sir <hi>John Smith,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeoffries,</hi> ſhould go Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners

for the Eſtates; and Mr. <hi>Broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Lauſon</hi> and <hi>Wood</hi> for the Kirk: and theſe having received their Commiſſions, met the King at <hi>Breda,</hi> where, after their Speeches made to his Majeſty, they then delivered their Propoſitions, much to the ſame effect of thoſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>Now, during this Treaty, the Marqueſs of <hi>Montroſs</hi> was ſeized in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he was with a moſt barbarous inhumanity, expoſed to all the ſeverneſs imaginable: a Gibbet ſet up for him, of a height extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, where he was hanged, and then quartered; with all the circumſtances of a ſolemn and a deliberate cruelty and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, to the eternal infamy of that Faction, which would, in the very inſtance of an overture, and Treaty of accord, proceed to ſo unheard of an outrage upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſo loyal a Subject to his and their Sovereign. This was the fatal and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Event of his Majeſties Affairs in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the Report of this News at <hi>Breda,</hi> the King was much Troubled, and all the Treaty had like to have broken off upon it; but yet the King at length, through the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his Affairs, concluded the Treaty by condeſcending to moſt of the Propoſitions
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65606:187"/>
and this Concluſion being carryed to <hi>Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> after much Debate, it was Reſolved another Meſſage ſhould be ſent to invite the King over, but the Parliament here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having notice of all thoſe proceedings in <hi>Scotland,</hi> prepared an Army thereupon to Invade <hi>Scotland,</hi> under the Command of their General <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and they had alſo about this time put out an Act for the bringing all Proceedings at Law into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, and Secretary hand; which continued ſo for about ſome ten years.</p>
               <p>And about this time alſo their Admiral General <hi>Blake</hi> took, ſunck and burnt moſt of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Fleet, which was a great hurt to the Kings Affairs. And now the King being arived at <hi>Spey</hi> in the North of <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſome Lords were ſent down to accompany him to <hi>Edenborough;</hi> as he came along he was entertained with the general Joy of all the People, and at <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berden</hi> he was preſented with 1500 pounds, which thing was ill taken by the Commitee of Eſtates and Kirk; and therefore they ſent their Injunction to prohibit other places from doing the like: and the King being now come to <hi>Edenborough,</hi> he was again proclaimed King on the 15 of <hi>July Anno</hi> 1650, but his Coronation was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

by reaſon of the then Troubles, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army was upon their Borders; ſo the <hi>Scots</hi> now began to think how they might defend themſelves, and therefore they marched under the Command of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and ſet upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Muſclebrough,</hi> but were worſted, and at <hi>Dunbarr</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> wholly routed them and gained the Paſs there: this newes was brought to the King at St. <hi>Johnſtons,</hi> much about the ſame time when the death of his Siſter the Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was brought to him: ſo ſhortly after this he left the States of <hi>Scotland</hi> and repaired into the North of that Kingdom, being no longer able to endure the Affronts put upon him.</p>
               <p>And now, beſides the danger of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Army then in the Bowels of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they themſelves were yet devided into three Partys, ſo that nothing but ruin could be expected among them: but the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning with <hi>Montgomery</hi> to St. <hi>Johnſtons</hi> again, they were then all reconciled among themſelves, and the King on the firſt day of <hi>January Anno</hi> 1650, was Crowned at <hi>Scoon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the King ſet up his Standard at <hi>Abberdeen,</hi> and reſolved himſelf to be <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of the <hi>Scoth</hi> Army: and about this time was Sir <hi>Henry Hyde</hi> beheaded
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65606:188"/>
at <hi>London</hi> for his Loyalty; and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Captain <hi>Brown Buſhel</hi> received the like Doom, for performing ſome ſignal Services for the King.</p>
               <p>And the King now began to Fortifie <hi>Sterling,</hi> to which place he afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Court, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> drew nigher and nigher every day, and had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Earl of <hi>Eglington,</hi> and one of his Sons: but whileſt things were thus in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation in <hi>Scotland,</hi> a Plot was diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in <hi>England</hi> againſt the Parliament, moſt of which Plotters were <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and two of them, being Miniſters, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Gibbons</hi> and Mr. <hi>Love</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for their Treaſon as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment called it: now <hi>Cromwell</hi> perceiving that he could not draw the <hi>Scots</hi> to a Field Battel, preſently tranſported over the <hi>Fife</hi> 1600 Foot, and 4 Troops of <hi>Horſe,</hi> who with the help of <hi>Lambert</hi> and <hi>Okey</hi> routed Sir <hi>John Brown</hi>'s Forces, took him, and ſeveral other perſons of Quality, Priſoners, and ſlew two thouſand upon the place, and took near 120 Priſoners.</p>
               <p>Now the King, ſeeing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſo faſt, thought it beſt to acquit <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſo marched for <hi>England,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his march the laſt day of <hi>July, Anno</hi> 1651, <hi>Cromwell</hi> ſeeing this, ſent <hi>Lambert</hi>

after them with a ſelect party of Horſe to fall upon their Rear, and himſelf with the reſt that could be ſpared followed, and the Parliament alſo hearing of the King's March, interdicted all Aid and Aſſiſtance either of men or money to be given to his Majeſty, under the penalty of High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and they alſo cauſed numerous For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be raiſed in moſt Counties in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King's Army now in <hi>England</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed themſelves very civilly, yet for all that, the People were ſo beſorted, that they came very ſlowly into his Aſſiſtance, for few or none came during this tedious march; ſaving the Lore <hi>Howard's</hi> Son of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrich</hi> with a Troop of Horſe; and now <hi>Lambert</hi> with his Men having been guided over the Dales and Moors in <hi>York-ſhire</hi> got the Advantage of the King's Army in their March, and inſtead of following them, got before them, and thought to have ſtopt the King's Army at <hi>Warrington</hi>-Bridg, but after an hot Diſpute and the loſs of ſome men the King at length gained the paſſage over the Bridg, and coming to <hi>Tong Norton,</hi> he ſent a Trumpeter with his Summons to Collonell <hi>Humphry Mack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> Governour of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up the Town; but he ſent the King a

flat denial, giving him the Title only of <hi>Commander in chief of the</hi> Scottiſh <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> in the Superſcription of his Letter he ſent back: from hence the King marched on to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where he entered the Town, the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> a little before had brought him a ſupply of 250 Foot and 60 Horſe out of the <hi>Iſle of Man,</hi> and was gon into <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> in hopes to have gotten more Forces there, but was routed there by <hi>Lilborn:</hi> and moſt of his cheif Commanders ſlain, as the Lord <hi>Withring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Tilſly,</hi> Collonel <hi>Trollop,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Bointon;</hi> and ſome others taken: This misfortune was imputed to the diſappointment his Lordſhip received in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> to which place his Majeſty had ordered him to repair, with aſſurance that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> would frely join with him, in order to his Majeſties Reſtauration; but, coming thither, he found it otherwiſe, and that they did all they could to hinder any Conjunction, unleſs he would take the Covenant; which refuſing to do, he was forced upon that Engagement before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (in <hi>Wiggon</hi>-lane) where he behaved himſelf with all poſſible bravery, and Col. <hi>Maſſy</hi> alſo had his part in the Honor of this occaſion.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty all this time was buſie

<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65606:190"/>
put the Royal party to the Retreat; and the King had his Horſe twice ſhot under him, and not able to rally again, they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly into the Town; where the <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wellian</hi> party entered pell mell with them, and then the Cry went, <hi>Save the King, Save the King:</hi> And now the King, ſeeing all gone, with ſome Nobles and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, with much difficulty, got away; and coming to a Farmers Houſe in the Borders of <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> there he diſrobed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for want of a pair of Sciſſars had his Hair cut off with a Knife; and ſo he, with the Company of one Friend (who brought him Proviſion towards Night) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himſelf into a Wood, about 4 miles from <hi>Woolverhampton,</hi> where he made an <hi>Oak</hi> his Pallace, and the Soldiers all this while were hunting about, like Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds for the King, a Thouſand pound being the promiſed Reward of thoſe that could take him. But ſome few dayes after he was conveyed to the Houſe of one Mris <hi>Jane Lane,</hi> who proved a faithful and loyal Subject to him, and was a chief Inſtrument in his conveyance beyond Seas; which after many Dangers paſt, he at length attained, landing at new-Haven in <hi>France.</hi> In the Battel at <hi>Worcester</hi> it is ſuppoſed there was about 3000 ſlain,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65606:191"/>
and 700 taken Priſoners. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to manifeſt their joy for this Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, cauſed dayes of Publick Thankſgiving to be made, and hung up all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in <hi>Westminster</hi>-Hall: and not long after this the Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> was beheaded at <hi>Bolton</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now the King being ſafely gotten to <hi>Paris;</hi> from thence after a while the King removed to St. <hi>Germains</hi> and did confer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for the recovery of his Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> but it came to nothing; ſo the King returning again to <hi>Paris:</hi> during his abode there, his Brother the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> (who had a long time been detained by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Iſle of Wight</hi>) came to viſit him, accompanied from the <hi>Hague</hi> with Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And not long after, his <hi>Quandam</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver Mris <hi>Jane Lane</hi> being eſcaped out of <hi>England</hi> arrived in <hi>France,</hi> and ſent Letters to his Majeſty, certifying him of her Arrival, who preſently ſent Coaches to conduct her to <hi>Paris,</hi> where his Majeſty gave her a large demonſtration of his Princely Favour and Bounty.</p>
               <p>Now whil'ſt the King was paſſing away his time thus in <hi>France;</hi> in the mean time
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65606:191"/>
                  <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> the 20 of <hi>April</hi> 1653 diſſolved the long-lived Parliament, which had ſate twelve years, ſix months and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen days, and in deriſion, they were cryed about the Streets, <hi>Parliament men Four a peny.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in this year, and the year preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were five bloody Ingagements at Sea between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Dutch:</hi> after the long Parliament diſſolved, <hi>Oliver</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another <hi>Juncto,</hi> who after they had ſate ſome ſmall time to little purpoſe, they reſigned up their Power again into his hand from whom they received it.</p>
               <p>And now, about the 16 of <hi>December, Anno</hi> 1653. <hi>Oliver Cromwel</hi> was ſworn Lord Protector of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo the Government was now again in a ſingle Perſon, againſt which they had all ſworn; and in <hi>April</hi> after the Protector concluded a Peace with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whoſe Aid and Aſſiſtance the King had ſtrongly ſollicited againſt him.</p>
               <p>The King ſeeing this, he ſought a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> hoping thereby to further his own Intereſt; he left <hi>France,</hi> and departed for <hi>Germany,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with his Coſin Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> taking his firſt Reſidence at the <hi>Spaw,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Royal Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange</hi>
                  <pb n="370" facs="tcp:65606:192"/>
came to viſit him; now during theſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages <hi>Oliver</hi> Protector had diſcovered a Plot in <hi>England</hi> againſt his Authority: and ſome of the Plotters were taken, and two of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> Collonel <hi>Gerrard</hi> and Mr. <hi>Vowel</hi> ſuffered Death: Indeed the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor had a cunning way in diſcovering of Plots, for he had his Inveaglers in ſeveral parts of <hi>England,</hi> who feigned themſelves great Favourers of the King's Cauſe, prickt Gentlemen on into Conſpiracies againſt the Protector, and when they were come to any head, and that the chief were inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſworn, and the day appointed for putting their Intentions in Execution, then forthwith were they diſcovered to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper; and ſo their Eſtates became Preys to his Coffers, and their Perſons to his Mercy, which was but ſmall, their heads being uſually their ranſoms to this man of Might: upon which account ſeveral wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen loſt their Lives, for no man could ſay, his Life was his own, if once <hi>Oliver</hi> did but frown upon him, for his Will was his Law, and this his Rule,</p>

               <p>Great indeed was the Awe the People ſtood in during his Uſurped Authority, for he carried MAGNA CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TA in his Sword-Hilt, and the Peoples Liberty in his well tempered Blade: and now they began to ſtir in <hi>Scotland</hi> again, and the Earl of <hi>Glencarn, Menro</hi> and <hi>Middleton</hi> having gotten ſome Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, intended again to have proſecuted the King's Cauſe, but they were routed by General <hi>Monk</hi> and Collonel <hi>Morgan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During theſe Stirs his Majeſty in the Company of his Royal Siſter had left the <hi>Spaw,</hi> and taken his Journy to <hi>Collen,</hi> where he and his Siſter were Royally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained: and ſhortly after they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by the Duke of <hi>Newburgh</hi> to his Pallace at <hi>Dunſel Dorf,</hi> where they were Nobly Feaſted; and here the King and his Siſter parted, ſhe returning for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and his Majeſty to <hi>Collen.</hi>

                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:65606:193"/>During theſe paſſages the Protector diſcovered another plot, which ſhould have been a general Riſing all over <hi>England,</hi> whereupon ſeveral were taken and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and abundance tranſported beyond Seas, and ſold for Slaves.</p>
               <p>And now the King, with his Brother the Duke of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and his Royal Siſter the Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> with ſeveral other Lords and Ladys took their Progreſs to ſee the Fair at <hi>Franckford,</hi> and at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningſtein</hi> near <hi>Franckford, Chriſtina</hi> Queen of <hi>Sweeden,</hi> and the King, gave one the other a Viſit: and his Majeſty having made his Abode at <hi>Franckford</hi> during ſo long time as he thought good; he then returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwell</hi> now, according to conditions, ſent over 6000 foot Soldiers to aid the <hi>French</hi> King in his Wars againſt <hi>Flanders:</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were to have <hi>Dunkirk</hi> in conſideration therof, which afterwards was delivered to them, after ſome difficulty paſſed. But during theſe Stirs beyond Seas, <hi>Oliver,</hi> by an Aſſembly, whereof Sir <hi>Thomas Witherington</hi> was Speaker, was
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65606:193"/>
inveſted with Purple Robes, and inſtalled in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall: after which he Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a Pageant houſe of Lords, moſt of them of his own Creation, ſuch as <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Hewſon,</hi> and the like: and not long after this, he diſcovered another Plot, and Sir <hi>Henry Slingby,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hewit,</hi> Mr. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stacy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Betly</hi> ſuffered death, the two firſt beheaded, and the other three hanged, drawn and quartered for being in the ſaid Plot, as <hi>Oliver</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>Now great was the Pomp and State this Protector of <hi>England</hi> aſſumed to himſelf, and as great the ſtate of his Son <hi>Henry,</hi> whom he had made Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland:</hi> he had alſo appointed Commiſſioners in moſt Eminent places in <hi>England,</hi> for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Miniſters, and given them power to eject <hi>Ignorant, Scandalous</hi> and <hi>Inſufficient</hi> Miniſters and Schoolmaſters, under which notion of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> many worthy Divines were thrown out of their livings, when the Truth was, Loyalty on their ſides and Covetouſneſs on the Adverſe ſide was the principal cauſe of their Eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> the Miniſter was in great favour with the Protector, and ſerved him in place of his <hi>Jeſter;</hi> among thoſe Parliaments that were called by this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector,

               <p>And now the Uſurped Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>Oliver</hi> drawing to a Period, his Glaſs being run, at length this Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Three Kingdoms, on the Third day of <hi>September, Anno</hi> 1658. was forced to yield himſelf Priſoner to death, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his own example) admitted neither of bail nor ranſom, but made him pay his laſt breath to his Will; and ſo in a great Wind he was hurried away into another World.</p>
               <p>After his death, he was laid in State at <hi>Somerſet</hi> houſe in the <hi>Strand,</hi> till the 23 of <hi>November</hi> after, and then his Funeral was celebrated at a vaſter Charge then hath formerly been uſed for the beſt Kings in the beſt of times: he was Inhumed in the Abby at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but his Reſurrection followednot longafter, for he with <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> who condemn'd King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, were both of them digged out of their Graves, and hanged in Chains at <hi>Tiburn</hi> that year the King was reſtored to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1660.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oliver</hi> being now gone, <hi>Richard</hi> his eldeſt

Son ſucceed him, whoſe head being thought to light, and his ſhoulders to weak for the Supportation of ſo weighty a Government, he was quickly thruſt out again from his Protectorſhip: and now <hi>Fletwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> (the chief Inſtruments in outing of <hi>Richard</hi>) with the reſt of the Army, called the old Parliament (turned out by <hi>Oliver</hi>) to their Places again, who willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſumed them: whileſt theſe proceedings were in hand, the Gentlemen in <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> about harveſt time 1659, roſe under the Conduct of Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> in defence of their Priviledges, and cauſe of the King; but <hi>Lambert</hi> being ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them by the Parliament, he routed them, and Sir <hi>George Booth</hi> was ſhortly after taken and ſent Priſoner to the Tower, and <hi>Lambert</hi> was gratified by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for this good Service with a thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>At this time the King, with his Brother the Duke of <hi>York</hi> were at <hi>Callis,</hi> ready to have waſted over, if this buſineſs of Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> had taken effect.</p>
               <p>And now <hi>Lambert</hi> began to harbour ſome conceptions of aſſuming to himſelf the Government (<hi>Oliver</hi> having chalked him out the way) and ſo turned out the <hi>Rump Parliament</hi> again (for ſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65606:195"/>
called this Fragment of the old Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) and then erected a New-nothing, of his own called a <hi>Committee of Safety;</hi> all this made well ſtill for the King's Cauſe: and now <hi>Lambert</hi> takes his March into the <hi>North</hi> as far as <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> intending to Fight General <hi>Monk,</hi> and ſo become ſole Lord and Maſter of all: but when he came there his men were unwilling to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and in the mean time the <hi>Rump</hi> had gotten together again (ſeven times a worſe Devil then before) and diſſolved his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Safety,</hi> and within a ſhort ſpace, they inticed all his Soldiers to deſert and leave him, ſo that he was left to ſhift for himſelf.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Rump</hi> now invited General <hi>Monk</hi> to March with his Army to <hi>London,</hi> which accordingly he did, and was received with much joy, but he was no ſooner come, but the <hi>Rump</hi> ſet him on work, to put ſome Violences upon the City, which he with great danger and peril performed, this gave the Citizens great occaſion to think, That he from whom they expected ſo much good, would prove their Ruin: but he ſoon gave them proofs of the contrary, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Troops into the City, in the quality of a Friend, and declaring himſelf for a free Parliament, which revived their hearts. His
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:65606:195"/>
firſt buſineſs was to reſtore the ſecluded Members to their places in the Houſe of Commons, upon which the Aſſembly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved it ſelf: and Writs were Iſſued out for a new Parliament, but with ſuch reſervation that people were doubtful what the Event would prove: for no Recuſant, Cavallier, nor Cavalleir's Son was to ſit in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>This <hi>healing Parliament</hi> (for ſo it was called) preſently after they were ſet, began to vote for the King, and great Debates there were about it, but at length it was carry'd for the King: and ſo the States Arms were pulled down every where, and the Kings Arms ſet up, and his Majeſty on <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 8 day of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1660. was proclaimed King at <hi>Whitehall</hi>-gate, and in the City with great Pomp, Bells ringing, Bonefires burning, and the Conduits flowing with wine as the Peoples hearts did with gladneſs.</p>
               <p>And now News was carryed, and Commiſſioners were ſent to the King to deſire his return to his Kingdoms and Crown, he being then at <hi>Breda</hi> in <hi>Holland:</hi> ſhortly after which he prepared for <hi>England,</hi> and on the 29 day of <hi>May</hi> 1660. landed at <hi>Dover,</hi> accompanied with his two Brothers <hi>James</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of

                  <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and ſome Lords and Gentlemen of his Attendance: he was met by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Monk</hi> and other Nobles, and the General kneeling down upon the ground, the King took him up, and dignified him with the <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Garter;</hi> himſelf putting the <hi>George</hi> about the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Neck, and the Dukes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Glouceſter</hi> tying on the <hi>Garter;</hi> and ſo marching to <hi>Black Heath</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> his Majeſty was attended on from thence by the Lord <hi>Monk's</hi> Army, all armed, and Swords drawn, and the Nobles and Gentry in Cloth of Silver, and other rich Apparrel, and the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and Aldermen, and a great Number of Cittizens in Velvet Coats, and Gold Chains about their Necks; and ſo in a moſt glorious manner he was conducted through <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Whitehall;</hi> and that night ſeveral Bonfires were made, which made the night ſhine like another day, but that at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> was moſt remarkable, where the Effigies of <hi>Oliver Cromwell</hi> was ſet up upon a Pole with the Common Wealth's Arms, an hour or two, and then caſt down into the fire and burnt.</p>
               <p>And now the Parliament being infinitely Satisfied with the King's happy Arrival,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65606:196"/>
did order that a Bill ſhould be prepared, for keeping a perpetuall <hi>Aniverſary</hi> for a day of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to God, for his great Mercy and Bleſſing to theſe Nations in the happy Reſturation of his Majeſty, and that the 29 day of <hi>May</hi> ſhould be ſet appart every year for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And now began the Judgements of God to overtake many of thoſe Capital Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors whoſe hands had been deeply Imbrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the late King's blood: and in <hi>October</hi> following 26 of the them were found guily of high Treaſon, and nine of them were executed the ſame Month, (to wit) <hi>Thomas Harriſon, Adrian Scroope, John Carew, John Jones, Gregory Clement, Thomas Scot, John Cooke, Hugh Peters,</hi> and <hi>Daniel Axtell;</hi> ſo that though divine Vengeance hath, many times Leaden feet, yet when it comes it hath Iron hands: no ſooner ſcarce was the King reſtored to his Crown, but his chiefeſt care was to reſtore the Church to its purity of worſhip, and ſo Biſhops were again ſetled in every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſs, and the Common Prayer reſtored. And now <hi>Mary</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Orange,</hi> being come over to viſit the King her Brother, fell ſick of the ſmall pox and dyed, which was no little grief to the King.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January</hi> after the King was reſtored
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65606:197"/>
to his Kingdoms, one <hi>Venner</hi> a wine Cooper with his <hi>Phanatick</hi> Proſelytes Rebelled, and with a deſperate Intention ſought to deſtroy all thoſe that were not of their Opinion, killing a man in <hi>Pauls Church-yard,</hi> and an Head-borough in <hi>Beach Lane;</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter other Miſchiefs done, they marched into <hi>Cane-wood,</hi> and about 3 days after return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and fell deſperately upon the City; and being oppoſed 22 of the Kings Liege Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſlain, and 22 of them, and the reſt with much ado were taken and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enner</hi> their Leader with 11 more of them were executed in ſeveral places in the City.</p>
               <p>And upon the 30 day of this ſame Moneth, the Carkaſſes of <hi>Oliver Cromwell, John Bradſhaw</hi> and <hi>Henry Ireton,</hi> were digged up out of their Graves, and were drawn on Hurdles to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> and there hanged, and their Carkaſes being buried under the Gallows, their heads were choped off, and were fixed upon Poles, and ſet up upon <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall: not long after this dyed the moſt prudent Prince <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> the King's Brother, to the great grief of all true <hi>Engliſh</hi> men: and upon the 23 day of <hi>Aprill, Anno</hi> 1661 being St. <hi>George's</hi> day, his Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second was Crowned at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
                  <pb n="381" facs="tcp:65606:197"/>
with great Splendor and Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, having the day before made a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent paſſage from the Tower through the City of <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now by God's bleſſing having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as the Title of this Epitomy makes mention, I ſhall here Conclude with Saint <hi>Peter, Fear God,</hi> and <hi>Honour the King.</hi> And ſo God grant King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second a long and happy Reign.</p>
